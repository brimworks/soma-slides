Blessed Be The Name Of The Lord
--

Blessed be your name
In the land that is plentiful
Where Your streams of abundance flow
Blessed be Your name

Blessed be your name
When I'm found in the desert place
Though I walk through the wilderness
Blessed be Your name 

--

Every blessing You pour out
I’ll turn back to praise
When the darkness closes in Lord
Still I will say...

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your way
My heart will always choose to say,
Lord blessed be Your name

--

Blessed be your name
When the sun's shining down on me
When the world's all as it should be
Blessed be your name

Blessed be your name
On the road marked with suffering
Though there's pain in the offering
Blessed be your name

--

Every blessing You pour out
I’ll turn back to praise
When the darkness closes in Lord
Still I will say...

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your way
My heart will always choose to say,
Lord blessed be Your name 

--

You give and take away
You give and take away
My heart will choose to say
Lord Blessed be your name

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your way
My heart will always choose to say,
Lord blessed be Your name

How Great is our God
--

The splendor of a King,
clothed in Majesty
Let all the earth rejoice,
all the earth rejoice.
He wraps Himself in light,
and darkness tries to hide
And trembles at His voice,
trembles at His voice.

--

How great is our God, sing with me,
How great is our God, all will see
How great, how great is our God.

--

Age to age He stands,
and time is in His hands,
Beginning and the end,
beginning and the end.
The Godhead, three in one:
Father, Spirit, Son,
The Lion and the Lamb,
the Lion and the Lamb

--

How great is our God, sing with me,
How great is our God, all will see
How great, how great is our God.

--

Name above all names,
Worthy of all Praise
My heart will sing
How great is our God. (2x)

--

How great is our God, sing with me,
How great is our God, all will see
How great, how great is our God.

A Prayer for Faith
--

My Heart is glad, that you are my Father
Adopted to you, as sons and daughters
And Your love endures, as You said it would
And my heart sings…

--

Teach me, the sound of Your voice
With the faith to respond, to love you…
Teach me, to follow you close
With the faith you bestow, to love you…

--

My heart is glad, to serve you as King
Forgive the times, that I am stubborn
With a humble heart, may I come to you
And my heart sings…

--

Teach me, the sound of Your voice
With the faith to respond, to love you…
Teach me, to follow you close
With the faith you bestow, to love you…

My God My Father
--

My God, my Father! while I stray
Far from my home in lifeʼs rough way,
O teach me from my heart to say,
Thy will be done!

--

Though dark my path, and sad my lot, 
Let me be still, and murmur not, 
Or breathe the prayer divinely taught, 
Thy will be done! 

--

But if my fainting heart be blessed 
With the Holy Spirit for its guest, 
My God! to Thee I leave the rest--
Thy will be done!

--

If Thou should call me to resign 
What most I prize, never was mine; 
I only yield Thee what is Thine; 
Thy will be done! (x2)

--

Renew my will from day to day 
Blend it with Thine and take away 
All that now makes it hard to say 
Thy will be done! (2x)

--

My God, my Father! while I stray
Far from my home in lifeʼs rough way,
O teach me from my heart to say,
Thy will be done! (4x)

Holy is the Lord
--

We stand and lift up our hands         
For the joy of the Lord is our strength
We bow down and worship Him now                      
How great how awesome is He
And together we sing

--

Holy is the Lord God Almighty   
The earth is filled with His glory  
Holy is the Lord God Almighty   
The earth is filled with His glory   
The earth is filled with His glory

--

We stand and lift up our hands   
For the joy of the Lord is our strength  
We bow down and worship Him now   
How great, how awesome is He
And together we sing   
Everyone sing

Holy is the Lord God Almighty 
The earth is filled with His glory   
Holy is the Lord God Almighty   
The earth is filled with His glory  
The earth is filled with His glory

--

It's rising up all around  
It's the anthem of the Lord's renown

--

Holy is the Lord God Almighty 
The earth is filled with His glory   
Holy is the Lord God Almighty   
The earth is filled with His glory  
The earth is filled with His glory

Rain
--

When I wake, You're there
When I run, You run for me
When I call, You listen
Just to believe that You want me
Makes me think
I'm bound to know You

--

Rain down on me
Give me the eyes to see
Rain down on me
And I will believe

--

When I wake, You're there
When I run, You run for me
When I call, You listen
Just to believe that You want me
Makes me think
I'm bound to know You

--

Rain down on me
Give me the eyes to see
Rain down on me
And I will believe

--

Make my life a prayer to You
Lord to do what You want me to
Rain Your Spirit down on me

--

Rain down on me
Give me the eyes to see
Rain down on me
And I will believe

When I wake, You're there
When I run, You run for me
When I call, You listen
