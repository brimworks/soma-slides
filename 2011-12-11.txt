Angels, from the Realms of Glory
--

Angels, from the realms of glory
Wing your flight over all the earth
Ye who sang creation's story
Now proclaim Messiah's birth

--

Come and worship, Come and worship
Worship Christ the newborn King!

--

Shepherds, in the fields abiding,
Watching o'er your flocks by night,
God with us is now residing,
Yonder shines the infant Light:

--

Come and worship, Come and worship
Worship Christ the newborn King!

--

Sages, leave your contemplations,
Brighter visions beam afar;
Seek the great Desire of Nations;
Ye have seen His natal star:

--

Come and worship, Come and worship
Worship Christ the newborn King!

--

Saints, before the altar bending,
Watching long in hope and fear,
Suddenly the Lord, descending,
In His temple shall appear:

--

Come and worship, Come and worship
Worship Christ the newborn King!

--
Joy to the World
--

Joy to the world, the Lord is come!
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing

--

Joy to the earth, the Savior reigns!
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy

--

No more let sins and sorrows grow
Nor thorns infest the ground
He comes to make His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found
Far as the curse is found
Far as, far as, the curse is found

--

He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His lov,
And wonders, wonders, of His love

Sermon

What Child is This?
--

What Child is this who, laid to rest
On Maryâ€™s lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?

--

This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste, to bring Him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary

--

Why lies He in such mean estate,
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christians, fear, for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading.

--

This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste, to bring Him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary

--

So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh
Come peasant, king to own Him
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him

--

Raise, raise a song on high,
The virgin sings her lullaby.
Joy, joy for Christ is born,
The Babe, the Son of Mary.

--
Come Thou Long Expected Jesus
--

Come, Thou long expected Jesus
Born to set Thy people free
From our fears and sins release us
Let us find our rest in Thee 

--

Israel's Strength and Consolation
Hope of all the earth Thou art 
Dear Desire of every nation 
Joy of every longing heart 

--

Born Thy people to deliver
Born a child and yet a King
Born to reign in us forever
Now Thy gracious kingdom bring

--

By Thine own eternal Spirit
Rule in all our hearts alone
By Thine all sufficient merit
Raise us to Thy glorious throne

--
Angels we Have Heard on High
--

Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing over the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains

--

Glo--ria, in excelsis Deo!
Glo--ria, in excelsis Deo!

--

Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song?

--

Glo--ria, in excelsis Deo!
Glo--ria, in excelsis Deo!

--

Come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing
Come, adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord, the newborn King

--

Glo--ria, in excelsis Deo!
Glo--ria, in excelsis Deo!

--

See Him in a manger laid
Jesus, Lord of heaven and earth
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid
With us sing our Savior's birth

--

Glo--ria, in excelsis Deo!
Glo--ria, in excelsis Deo!

I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day
--

I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth, good will to men

--

I thought how, as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along the unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men

--

And in despair I bowed my head
"There is no peace on earth," I said
"For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men"

--

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
"God is not dead, nor doth he sleep
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
With peace on earth, good will to men"

--

Till, ringing singing, on its way
The world revolved from night to day
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime
Of peace on earth, good will to men!
