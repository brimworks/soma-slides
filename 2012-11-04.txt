Jesus Paid It All
--

And I hear the Savior say
"Thy strength indeed is small
Child of weakness watch and pray
Find in Me thine all in all"

--

'Cause Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow
(It's washed away)
(All my sin and all my shame)

--

Lord now indeed I find
Thy pow'r and Thine alone
Can change the leper's spots
And melt the heart of stone

--

'Cause Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow
(It's washed away)
(All my sin and all my shame)

--

And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete
Jesus died my soul to save
My lips shall still repeat

--

Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow (3x)

--

Oh praise the One Who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead

Jesus

The Love of Christ is Rich and Free
--

The love of Christ is rich and free
Fixed on His own eternally
Nor earth, nor hell, can it remove
Long as He lives, His own He’ll love

--

His loving heart engaged to be 
Their everlasting Surety
’Twas love that took their cause in hand
And love maintains it to the end 

--

Love cannot from its post withdraw
Nor death, nor hell, nor sin, nor law
Can turn the Surety’s heart away 
He’ll love His own to endless day

--

Love has redeemed His sheep with blood
And love will bring them safe to God
Love calls them all from death to life
And love will finish all their strife

--

He loves through every changing scene
Nor aught from Him can Zion wean 
Not all the wanderings of her heart 
Can make His love for her depart

--

Love cannot from its post withdraw
Nor death, nor hell, nor sin, nor law 
Can turn the Surety’s heart away
He’ll love His own to endless day

--

At death, beyond the grave, He’ll love
In endless bliss, His own shall prove 
The blazing glory of that love 
Which never could from them remove

--
Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing
--

Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

--

Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the mount I'm fixed upon it
Mount of Thy redeeming love

--

Here I raise my Ebenezer
Hither by Thy help I'm come
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home

--

Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wandering from the fold of God
He, to rescue me from danger
Interposed His precious blood

--

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee

--

Prone to wander Lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart O take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above

How Deep the Father's Love for Us
--

How deep the Father's love for us
How vast beyond all measure
That He would give His only Son
To make a wretch His treasure

--

How great the pain of searing loss
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the chosen One
Bring many sons to glory

--

Behold the Man upon a cross
My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers 

--

It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished

--

I will not boast in anything
No gifts, no powers, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection

--

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom

--
Doxology
--

Praise God, from Whom all blessings flow;
Praise Him, all creatures here below;
Praise Him above, ye heavenly host;
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

Amen (4x)
