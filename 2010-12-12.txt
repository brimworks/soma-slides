Jesus Paid It All
--

And I hear the Savior say
"Thy strength indeed is small
Child of weakness watch and pray
Find in Me thine all in all"

--

'Cause Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow
(It's washed away)
(All my sin and all my shame)

--

Lord now indeed I find
Thy pow'r and Thine alone
Can change the leper's spots
And melt the heart of stone

--

'Cause Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow
(It's washed away)
(All my sin and all my shame)

--

And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete
Jesus died my soul to save
My lips shall still repeat

--

Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow (3x)

--

Oh praise the One Who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead

Jesus

SERMON

Beautiful Scandalous Night
--

Go on up to the mountain of mercy
To the crimson perpetual tide
Kneel down on the shore
Be thirsty no more
Go under and be purified

--

Follow Christ to the holy mountain
Sinner sorry and wrecked by the fall
Cleanse your heart and your soul
In the fountain that flows
For you and for me and for all

--

At the wonderful tragic mysterious tree
On that beautiful scandalous night
You and me were atoned by His blood
And forever washed white
On that beautiful scandalous night

--

On the hillside you will be delivered
At the foot of the cross justified
And your spirit restored
By the river that pours
From our blessed Savior's side

--

At the wonderful tragic mysterious tree
On that beautiful scandalous night
You and me were atoned by His blood
And forever washed white
On that beautiful scandalous night

--

On that beautiful scandalous night
Miraculous night

Everyone needs compassion
Love that's never failing

Everyone needs forgiveness
The kindness of a Saviour
The hope of nations

So take me as You find me
All my fears and failures
Fill my life again

Everything I believe in
Now I surrender

Joy to the world the Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing

While fields and floods
Rocks hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy

Nor thorns infest the ground
He comes to make His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found
Far as the curse is found
Far as far as the curse is found

He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders and wonders of His love
