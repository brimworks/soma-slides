O For a Thousand Tongues
--

O, for a thousand tongues to sing
My great redeemers praise
The glories of my God and King
The triumphs of His grace

--

My gracious Master and my God
Assist me to proclaim
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honors of Thy name

--

So praise the name of Jesus!
So praise the name of Jesus!

--

Jesus the name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease,
Tis music in the sinner ears,
Tis life and health and peace.

--

He breaks the power of cancelled sin
He sets the prisoners free
His blood can make the foulest clean
His blood availed for me

--

So praise the name of Jesus!
So praise the name of Jesus!

--

He speaks, and, listening to His voice,
New life the dead receive,
The mournful, broken hearts rejoice,
The humble poor believe.

--

Glory to God and praise and love
Be ever, ever given
By saints below and saints above
The church in earth and Heaven

--

So praise the name of Jesus!
So praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

Message

Message

Your Love Is Strong
--

Heavenly Father
You always amaze me
Let your kingdom come
In my world and in my life

--

Give me the food I need
To live through today
And forgive me as I forgive
The people that wronged me

--

Lead me far from temptation
Deliver me from the evil one

--

I look out the window
The birds are composing
Not a note is out of tune
Or out of place

--

I look at the meadow
And stare at the flowers
Better dressed than any girl
On her wedding day

--

So why do I worry?
Why do I freak out?
God knows what I need
You know what I need

--

Your love is
Your love is
Your love is strong

--

The kingdom of the heavens
Is now advancing
Invade my heart
Invade this broken town

--

The kingdom of the heavens
Is buried treasure
Will you sell yourself
To buy the one you've found?

--

Two things you told me
That you are strong
And you love me
Yes, you love me

--

Your love is
Your love is
Your love is strong

--

Oh God in heaven
Hallowed be
Thy name above all names
Your kingdom come
Your will be done
On earth as it is in heaven

--

Give us today our daily bread
Forgive us weary sinners
Lead us far from our vices
And deliver us from these prisons

--
In Christ Alone
--

In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm

--

What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
My Comforter, my All in All
Here in the love of Christ I stand

--

In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save

--

Till on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

--

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again

--

And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

--

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny

--

No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand

--
Here I am To Worship
--

Light of the world 
You stepped down into darkness 
Opened my eyes, let me see 
Beauty that made this heart adore you
Hope of a life spent with You 

--

So here I am to worship 
Here I am to bow down 
Here I am to say that You're my God 
You're altogether lovely,
altogether worthy
You are altogether wonderful to me 

--

King of all days 
Oh so highly exalted 
Glorious in Heaven above 
Humbly You came to the earth You created 
All for love's sake became poor

--

So here I am to worship 
Here I am to bow down 
Here I am to say that You're my God 
You're altogether lovely,
altogether worthy
You are altogether wonderful to me 

--

I'll never know, how much it cost 
To see my sin upon that cross

--

So here I am to worship 
Here I am to bow down 
Here I am to say that You're my God 
You're altogether lovely,
altogether worthy
You are altogether wonderful to me 

--

Light of the world 
You stepped down into darkness 
Opened my eyes, let me see
