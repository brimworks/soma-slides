O Holy Night
--

O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Saviour's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks, a new and glorious morn

--

Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices
O night divine, O night when Christ was born
O night, O holy night, O night divine

--

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here came the wise men from Orient land
The King of Kings, lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friend

--

He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger
Behold, your King, before Him lowly bend
Behold, your King, before Him lowly bend

--

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love, and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name

--

Christ is the Lord, O praise His name forever
His power and glory
ever more proclaim

What Love is This?
--

You never change
You are the God You say You are 
When I'm afraid
You calm and still my beating heart 
You stay the same
When hope is just a distant thought 
You take my pain 
And You lead me to the cross 

--

What love is this
That You gave Your life for me 
And made a way for me to know You 
And I confess You're always enough for me 
You're all I need 

--

I look to You 
I see the scars upon Your hands 
And hold the truth 
That when I can't You always can
I'm standing here beneath
The shadow of the cross
I'm overwhelmed
That I Keep finding open arms 

--

What love is this that
That you gave Your life for me
And made a way for me to know You 
And I confess, You're always enough for me 
You're all I need

You were reaching; You thought of me 
Jesus in Your suffering
You were reaching; You thought of me

Angels we Have Heard on High
--

Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing oâ€™er the plains,
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains.

--

Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!

--

Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song?

--

Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!

--

Come to Bethlehem and see
Christ Whose birth the angels sing;
Come, adore on bended knee,
Christ the Lord, the newborn King.

--

Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!

--

See Him in a manger laid,
Whom the choirs of angels praise;
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,
While our hearts in love we raise.

Silent Night
--

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, All is bright
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy Infant so Tender and mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace,
Sleep in heavenly peace.

--

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight,
Glories stream from heaven afar,
Heavenly hosts sing Alleleu- lia
Christ the Saviour is born!
Christ the saviour is born.

--

Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
with the dawn of redeeming grace,
Jesus Lord at thy birth,
Jesus Lord at thy birth.
