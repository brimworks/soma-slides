Indescribable
--

From the highest of heights
to the depths of the sea
Creation's revealing Your majesty
From the colors of Fall
to the fragrance of Spring
Every creature unique in the
song that it sings
All exclaiming

--

Indescribable, Uncontainable,
You placed the stars in the sky
and You know them by name
You are amazing, God

All powerful, Untamable,
Awestruck we fall to our knees
as we humbly proclaim
You are amazing, God

--

Who has told every lightning
bolt where it should go
Or seen heavenly store
houses laden with snow
Who imagined the Sun and
gives source to its light
Yet conceals it to bring us
the coolness of night,

None can fathom

--

Indescribable, Uncontainable,
You placed the stars in the sky

All powerful, Untamable,
Awestruck we fall to our knees
as we humbly proclaim
You are amazing, God

Incomparable, Unchangeable,

You see the depths of my
heart and you love me the same

You are amazing God
You are amazing God

--

Indescribable, Uncontainable,
You placed the stars in the sky
and You know them by name
You are amazing, God

All powerful, Untamable,
Awestruck we fall to our knees
as we humbly proclaim
You are amazing, God

Wonderful Maker
--

You spread out the skies over empty space 
Said "Let there be light"
To a dark and formless world
Your light was born

--

Said "Let there be light"
To a dark and hopeless world
Your Son was born

And saw that it was good
You sent Your only son
For You are good

What a wonderful Maker 
What a wonderful Savior
How majestic Your whispers,
And how humble Your love
With a strength like no other
And the heart of a Father
How majestic Your whispers,
What a wonderful God

No eye has fully seen, how beautiful the cross
And we have only heard, the faintest whispers
Of how great You are

You made the world
And saw that it was good
You sent Your only son
For You are good

House Of God Forever 
--

God is my Shepherd
I won't be wanting,
I won't be wanting
He makes me rest
In fields of green by quiet streams

--

Even though I walk
Through the valley of death and dying
I will not fear
For You are with me,
You're always with me

--

Your Shepherd's staff comforts me
You are my feast in the presence of enemies
Surely goodness will follow me, follow me
In the House of God, forever

Better is One Day

How lovely is your dwelling place
Oh Lord Almighty 
My soul longs and even faints for You
For here my heart is satisfied  
Within your presence
I sing beneath the shadow of your wings

--

Better is one day in your courts
Better is one day in your house
Better is one day in your courts
Than thousands elsewhere

--

One thing I ask and I would seek
To see your beauty
To find you in the place your glory dwells

--

Better is one day in your courts
Better is one day in your house
Better is one day in your courts
Than thousands elsewhere

--

My heart and flesh cry out
For you the living God
Your spirit's water for my soul
I've tasted and I've seen
Come once again to me
I will draw near to you
I will draw near to you

--

Better is one day in your courts
Better is one day in your house
Better is one day in your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
