Blessed Be Your Name
--

Blessed be your name,
In the land that is plentiful
Where Your streams of abundance flow
Blessed be Your name

--

Blessed be your name
When I'm found in the desert place
Though I walk through the wilderness
Blessed be Your name 

--

Every blessing You pour out
I'll turn back to praise
When the darkness closes in Lord
Still I will say

--

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your way
My heart will always say,
Lord Blessed be your name

--

Blessed be your name
When the sun's shining down on me
When the world's all as it should be
Blessed be your name

--

Blessed be your name
On the road marked with suffering
Though there's pain in the offering
Blessed be your name

--

Every blessing You pour out I'll
turn back to praise
When the darkness closes in, Lord
Still I will say...

--

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your way
My heart will always say,
Lord Blessed be your name

--

You give and take away
You give and take away
My heart will always say
Lord Blessed be your name

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your way
My heart will always say,
Lord Blessed be your name

Living Water
--

How lovely is Your dwelling place
Oh Lord God Almighty
My soul yearns, it even faints
For the courts of the Lord

--

You fill my soul with Your living water and I, 
am your child
You fill my soul with Your living water and I, 
am your child

--

Oh Lord, God who saves me,
Day and night I cry out before You
May my prayer come before You
Turn Your ear to my cry

--

You fill my soul with Your living water and I, 
am your child
You fill my soul with Your living water and I, 
am your child

Hallelujah...

Arms of Love
--

I sing a simple song of love
To my Savior, to my Jesus
I'm grateful for the things You've done
My loving Savior oh precious Jesus

--

My heart is glad
that You've called me Your own
And there's no place I'd rather be

--

Than in Your arms of love
In Your arms of love
Holding me still holding me near
In Your arms of love

--

I sing a simple song of love
To my Savior, to my Jesus
I'm grateful for the things You've done
My loving Savior oh precious Jesus

--

My heart is glad
that You've called me Your own
And there's no place I'd rather be

--

Than in Your arms of love
In Your arms of love
Holding me still holding me near
In Your arms of love

Strong Tower
--

When I wander through the desert
And I'm longing for my home
All my dreams have gone astray
When I'm stranded in the valley
And I'm tired and all alone
It seems like I've lost my way

--

I go running to Your Mountain
Where your mercy sets me free...

--

You are my strong tower
Shelter over me
Beautiful and mighty
Everlasting King
You are my strong tower
Fortress when I'm weak
Your name is true and holy
And Your face is all I seek

--

In the middle of my darkness
In the midst of all my fear
You're my refuge and my hope
When the storm of life is raging
And the thunder's all I hear
You speak softly to my soul

--

I go running to Your Mountain
Where your mercy sets me free...

--

You are my strong tower
Shelter over me
Beautiful and mighty
Everlasting King
You are my strong tower
Fortress when I'm weak
Your name is true and holy
And Your face is all I seek

--

When I wander through the desert
And I'm longing for my home
All my dreams have gone astray
When I'm stranded in the valley
And I'm tired and all alone
It seems like I've lost my way

--

I go running to Your Mountain
Where your mercy sets me free...

--

You are my strong tower
Shelter over me
Beautiful and mighty
Everlasting King
You are my strong tower
Fortress when I'm weak
Your name is true and holy
And Your face is all I seek

--
My God My Father
--

My God, my Father while I stray
Far from my home in life's rough way
O teach me from my heart to say
Thy will be done

--

Though dark my path, and sad my lot
Let me be still, and murmur not
Or breathe the prayer divinely taught
Thy will be done!

--

But if my fainting heart be blessed
With the Holy Spirit for its guest
My God to Thee I leave the rest
Thy will be done!

--

If Thou should call me to resign
What most I prize, never was mine
I only yield Thee what is Thine
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!

--

Renew my will from day to day
Blend it with Thine and take away
All that now makes it hard to say
Thy will be done!
(2x)

--

Then when on earth I breathe no more
The prayer oft mixed with tears before
I'll sing upon that joyful shore
Thy will be done!

--

My God, my Father while I stray
Far from my home in life's rough way
O teach me from my heart to say
Thy will be done

--

Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!

Jesus Paid it All
--

I hear the Savior say,
Thy Strength indeed is small                  
Child of weakness watch and pray
Find in Me thine all in all
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
Sin has left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy power and Thine alone          
Can change the lepers spots
And melt the heart of stone   
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
Sin has left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete          
Jesus died my soul to save,
My lips shall still repeat   
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
Sin has left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

O praise the one who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead
