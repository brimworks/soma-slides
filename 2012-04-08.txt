Jesus Paid it All
--

I hear the Savior say,
Thy Strength indeed is small                  
Child of weakness watch and pray
Find in Me thine all in all
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
My sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy power and Thine alone          
Can change the lepers spots
And melt the heart of stone   
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
My sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete          
Jesus died my soul to save,
My lips shall still repeat   
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
My sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

O praise the one who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead

--
Mighty To Save
--

Everyone needs compassion
Love that's never failing
Let mercy fall on me
Everyone needs forgiveness
The kindness of a Saviour
The hope of nations

So take me as You find me
All my fears and failures
Fill my life again
I give my life to follow
Everything I believe in
Now I surrender

Message

When I Survey the Wondrous Cross
--

When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of glory died
My richest gain I count but loss
And pour contempt on all my pride

Forbid it Lord that I should boast
Save in the death of Christ my God
All the vain things that charm me most
I sacrifice them to His blood

See from His head His hands His feet
Sorrow and love flow mingled down
Did ever such love and sorrow meet
Or thorns compose so rich a crown

Were the whole realm of nature mine
That were an offering far too small
Love so amazing so divine
Demands my soul my life my all

--
In Christ Alone
--

In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm

--

What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
My Comforter, my All in All
Here in the love of Christ I stand

--

In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save

--

Till on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

--

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again

--

And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

--

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny

--

No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand

--
There is a Fountain
--

There is a fountain filled with blood
drawn from Emmanuel's veins
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains

--

The dying thief rejoiced to see
that fountain in his day;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away

--

Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
shall never lose its power
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved, to sin no more
Be saved, to sin no more
Be saved, to sin no more
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved, to sin no more

--

E'er since, by faith, I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die
And shall be till I die
And shall be till I die
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die

--

When this poor lisping, stammering
tongue lies silent in the grave.
Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I'll sing Thy power to save
I'll sing Thy power to save
I'll sing Thy power to save
Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I'll sing Thy power to save
