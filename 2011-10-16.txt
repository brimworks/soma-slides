All Hail the Power
--

All hail the power of Jesus' name
Let angels prostrate fall
Bring forth the royal diadem
And crown Him Lord of all
Bring forth the royal diadem
And crown Him Lord of all

--

Ye chosen seed of Israel's race
Ye ransomed from the fall
Hail Him who saves you by His grace
And crown Him Lord of all
Hail Him who saves you by His grace
And crown Him Lord of all

--

Let every kindred every tribe
On this terrestrial ball
To Him all majesty ascribe
And crown Him Lord of all
To Him all majesty ascribe
And crown Him Lord of all

--

O that with yonder sacred throng
We at His feet may fall
We'll join the everlasting song
And crown Him Lord of all
We'll join the everlasting song
And crown Him Lord of all

O For a Thousand Tongues
--

O, for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer praise
The glories of my God and King
The triumphs of His grace

--

My gracious Master and my God
Assist me to proclaim
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honors of Thy name

--

Jesus! The name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease,
Tis music in the sinner ears,
Tis life and health and peace.

--

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

--

He breaks the power of cancelled sin
He sets the prisoners free
His blood can make the foulest clean
His blood availed for me

--

Here Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb,
Your loosened tongues employ;
Ye blind, behold your Savior come;
And leap, ye lame, for joy.

--

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

--

Glory to God and praise and love
Be ever, ever given
By saints below and saints above
The church in earth and Heaven

--

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

There is no shadow of turning with Thee
Thou changest not Thy compassions they fail not 
As Thou hast been Thou forever wilt be

How Deep the Father's Love for Us
--

How deep the Father's love for us
How vast beyond all measure
That He would give His only Son
To make a wretch His treasure

--

How great the pain of searing loss
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the chosen One
Bring many sons to glory

--

Behold the Man upon a cross
My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers 

--

It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished

--

I will not boast in anything
No gifts, no powers, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection

--

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom

--
Unchanging
--

Great is Your faithfulness
Great is Your faithfulness
You never change
You never fail, O God

--

True are Your promises
True are Your promises
You never change
You never fail, O God

--

So we raise up holy hands
To praise the Holy One
Who was, and is, and is to come

--

Wide is Your love and grace
Wide is Your love and grace
You never change
You never fail, O God

--

You were
You are
You will always be

--
Holy is the Lord
--

We stand and lift up our hands         
For the joy of the Lord is our strength
We bow down and worship Him now                      
How great how awesome is He
And together we sing

--

Holy is the Lord God Almighty   
The earth is filled with His glory  
Holy is the Lord God Almighty   
The earth is filled with His glory   
The earth is filled with His glory

--

We stand and lift up our hands

Everyone sing

The earth is filled with His glory   
Holy is the Lord God Almighty   
The earth is filled with His glory

It's rising up all around  
It's the anthem of the Lord's renown

The earth is filled with His glory
Holy, holy is the Lord Almighty, holy, holy
