Come Thou Fount
--

Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise
Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above.
Praise His Name I'm fixed upon it
Name of God's redeeming love.

--

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be!
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter,
Bind my wandering heart to Thee:
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
Prone to leave the God I love;
Here's my heart, O take and seal it;
Seal it for Thy courts above.

--

Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

Kindness
--

Open up the skies of mercy
Rain down the cleansing flood
Healing waters rise around us
Hear our cries Lord, let â'em rise.

--

It's Your kindness, Lord,
that leads us to repentance
Your favor, Lord, is our desire
It's Your beauty, Lord,
that makes us stand in silence
Your love, Your Love is better than life

--

We can feel, Your mercy falling
You are turning our hearts back again.
Hear our praises rise to heaven,
Draw us near, Lord
Meet us here. 

--

It's Your kindness, Lord,
that leads us to repentance
Your favor, Lord, is our desire
It's Your beauty, Lord,
that makes us stand in silence
Your love, Your Love is better than life

Refine Me
--

I come into this place
Burning to receive your peace
I come with my own chains
From wars I've fought for my own selfish gain

--

You're my God and my Father
I've accepted your Son
But my soul feels so empty now
What have I become

--

Lord come with Your fire
Burn my desires refine me
Lord my will has deceived me
Please come and free me refine me

--

My heart can't see
When I only look at me
My soul can't hear
When I only think of my own fears

But they are gone in a moment
You're forever the same
Why did I look away from You
How can I speak Your name

--

Lord come with Your fire
Burn my desires refine me
Lord my will has deceived me
Please come and free me
Come rescue this child
For I long to be reconciled to You

--

It's all I can do
To give my heart and soul to You and pray
And pray oh I will pray

--

Lord come with Your fire
Burn my desires refine me
Lord my will has deceived me
Please come and free me
Come rescue this child
For I long to be reconciled to You

Refine me, refine me
Refine me, refine me

Thoughts of You
--

Thoughts of You and how You changed me 
Fill my mind 
Without You where would I be

--

So even though I've tried
to express my thanks 
It never comes out how I hoped 
I want to say so much more
so with these simple words I'll try

--

I love You 
My heart is Yours, only Yours 
I long to give You all of me 
My everything, my everything

--

You still loved me even when I 
Pushed You away 
You stood there and waited 
Till the day I'd return

--

God I never could repay You 
You gave everything 
Without You where would I be 

--

So even though I've tried
to express my thanks 
It never comes out how I hoped 
I want to say so much more
so with these simple words I'll try

--

I love You 
My heart is Yours, only Yours 
I long to give You all of me 
My everything, my everything

--
Living Water
--

How lovely is Your dwelling place
Oh Lord God Almighty
My soul yearns, it even faints
For the courts of the Lord

--

You fill my soul with Your living water and I, 
am your child
You fill my soul with Your living water and I, 
am your child

--

Oh Lord, God who saves me,
Day and night I cry out before You
May my prayer come before You
Turn Your ear to my cry

--

You fill my soul with Your living water and I, 
am your child
You fill my soul with Your living water and I, 
am your child

Hallelujah...

Strong Tower
--

When I wander through the desert
And I'm longing for my home
All my dreams have gone astray
When I'm stranded in the valley
And I'm tired and all alone
It seems like I've lost my way

--

I go running to Your Mountain
Where your mercy sets me free...

--

You are my strong tower
Shelter over me
Beautiful and mighty
Everlasting King
You are my strong tower
Fortress when I'm weak
Your name is true and holy
And Your face is all I seek

--

In the middle of my darkness
In the midst of all my fear
You're my refuge and my hope
When the storm of life is raging
And the thunder's all I hear
You speak softly to my soul

--

I go running to Your Mountain
Where your mercy sets me free...

--

You are my strong tower
Shelter over me
Beautiful and mighty
Everlasting King
You are my strong tower
Fortress when I'm weak
Your name is true and holy
And Your face is all I seek

--

When I wander through the desert
And I'm longing for my home
All my dreams have gone astray
When I'm stranded in the valley
And I'm tired and all alone
It seems like I've lost my way

--

I go running to Your Mountain
Where your mercy sets me free...

--

You are my strong tower
Shelter over me
Beautiful and mighty
Everlasting King
You are my strong tower
Fortress when I'm weak
Your name is true and holy
And Your face is all I seek
