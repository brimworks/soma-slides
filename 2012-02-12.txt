Be Thou My Vision
--

Be Thou my vision O Lord of my heart
Nought be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best thought by day or by night
Waking or sleeping Thy presence my light

--

Be Thou my Wisdom and Thou my true Word
I ever with Thee and Thou with me Lord
Thou my great Father I Thy true son
Thou in me dwelling and I with Thee one

--

Riches I heed not nor mans empty praise
Thou mine inheritance now and always
Thou and Thou only first in my heart
High King of heaven my treasure Thou art

--

High King of heaven, my victory won
May I reach heavens joys
O bright heavens sun!
Heart of my own heart whatever befall
Still be my vision O ruler of all

--
The Solid Rock
--

My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus’ blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus’ name

--


On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When darkness veils His lovely face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

His oath, His covenant, His blood
Support me in the whelming flood
When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my hope and stay

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh, may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the throne

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

Wonderful Maker
--

You spread out the skies over empty space 
Said "Let there be light"
To a dark and formless world
Your light was born

--

You spread out Your arms over empty hearts 
Said "Let there be light"
To a dark and hopeless world
Your Son was born

--

You made the world
And saw that it was good
You sent Your only son
For You are good

--

What a wonderful Maker 
What a wonderful Savior
How majestic Your whispers,
And how humble Your love
With a strength like no other
And the heart of a Father
How majestic Your whispers,
What a wonderful God

No eye has fully seen, how beautiful the cross
And we have only heard, the faintest whispers
Of how great You are

--

You made the world
And saw that it was good
You sent Your only son
For You are good

--

What a wonderful Maker 
What a wonderful Savior
How majestic Your whispers
And how humble Your love
With a strength like no other
And the heart of a Father
How majestic Your whispers
What a wonderful God

Victory in Jesus
--

I heard an old, old story,
How a savior came from glory
How He gave his life on Calvary
To save a wretch like me
I heard about His groaning,
His precious blood’s atoning
Then I repented of my sins
And won the victory

--

Oh victory in Jesus, my Savior forever
He sought me and bought me
With his redeeming blood
He loved me ere I knew him
And all my love is due him
He plunged me to victory
Beneath the cleansing flood

--

I heard about his healing,
Of His cleansing power revealing
How He made the lame to walk again
And caused the blind to see
And then I cried dear Jesus,
Come and heal my broken Spirit
And some how Jesus came
And bought to me the victory

--

Oh victory in Jesus, my Savior forever
He sought me and bought me
With his redeeming blood
He loved me ere I knew him
And all my love is due him
He plunged me to victory
Beneath the cleansing flood

--

I heard about a mansion
He has built for me in Glory
And I heard about the streets
Of Gold beyond the crystal sea
About the angels singing
And the old redemption story
And some sweet day I’ll sing up there
The song of victory

--

Oh victory in Jesus, my Savior forever
He sought me and bought me
With his redeeming blood
He loved me ere I knew him
And all my love is due him
He plunged me to victory
Beneath the cleansing flood
