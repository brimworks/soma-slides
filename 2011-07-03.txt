Psalm 27
--

The Lord is the light of my Salvation,
The Lord is the strength of my life,
Whom shall I fear, of whom shall I be afraid,
Whom shall I fear, O Lord
Whom shall I fear, whom shall I fear,
Of whom shall I be afraid?

--
Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing
--

Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

--

Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the name I'm fixed upon it
Name of God's redeeming love

--

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee

--

Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart, O take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above

--

Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

--
Refine Me
--

I come into this place
Burning to receive your peace
I come with my own chains
From wars I've fought for my own selfish gain

--

You're my God and my Father
I've accepted your Son
But my soul feels so empty now
What have I become

--

Lord come with Your fire
Burn my desires refine me
Lord my will has deceived me
Please come and free me refine me

--

My heart can't see
When I only look at me
My soul can't hear
When I only think of my own fears

But they are gone in a moment
You're forever the same
Why did I look away from You
How can I speak Your name

--

Lord come with Your fire
Burn my desires refine me
Lord my will has deceived me
Please come and free me
Come rescue this child
For I long to be reconciled to You

--

It's all I can do
To give my heart and soul to You and pray
And pray oh I will pray

--

Lord come with Your fire
Burn my desires refine me
Lord my will has deceived me
Please come and free me
Come rescue this child
For I long to be reconciled to You

Refine me, refine me
Refine me, refine me

How Great is Our God
--

The splendor of a King
clothed in Majesty
Let all the earth rejoice
All the earth rejoice

--

He wraps Himself in light
and darkness tries to hide
And trembles at His voice
Trembles at His voice

--

How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, all will see
How great, how great is our God

--

Age to age He stands
and time is in His hands
Beginning and the end
Beginning and the end

--

The Godhead, three in one
Father, Spirit, Son
The Lion and the Lamb
The Lion and the Lamb

--

How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, all will see
How great, how great is our God

--

Name above all names
Worthy of all Praise
My heart will sing
How great is our God
(2x)

--

How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, all will see
How great, how great is our God

--
King of All Glory
--

Who can stand next to Your majesty?
Next to Your holiness, who can stand?
What compares, faced with Your righteousness?
Faced with Your promises, what compares?

--

Here we are, by Your grace we stand
Matchless King, we've come to sing

--

Holy are You, Lord
King of all glory,
we have come to honor You
Holy are You, Lord
Heaven and earth ring,
singing Hallelujah

Holy

--

Here we are, by Your grace we stand
Matchless King, we've come to sing

--

Holy are You, Lord
King of all glory,
we have come to honor You
Holy are You, Lord
Heaven and earth ring,
singing Hallelujah

Rain
--

When I wake, You're there
When I run, You run for me
When I call, You listen

--

Just to believe that You want me
Makes me think
I'm bound to know You

--

Rain down on me
Give me the eyes to see
Rain down on me
And I will believe

--

When I wake, You're there
When I run, You run for me
When I call, You listen

--

Just to believe that You want me
Makes me think
I'm bound to know You

--

Rain down on me
Give me the eyes to see
Rain down on me
And I will believe

--

Make my life a prayer to You
Lord to do what You want me to
Rain Your Spirit down on me

--

Rain down on me
Give me the eyes to see
Rain down on me
And I will believe

--

When I wake, You're there
When I run, You run for me
