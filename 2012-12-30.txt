Be Thou My Vision
--

Be Thou my vision O Lord of my heart
Nought be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best thought by day or by night
Waking or sleeping Thy presence my light

--

Be Thou my Wisdom and Thou my true Word
I ever with Thee and Thou with me Lord
Thou my great Father I Thy true son
Thou in me dwelling and I with Thee one

--

Riches I heed not nor mans empty praise
Thou mine inheritance now and always
Thou and Thou only first in my heart
High King of heaven my treasure Thou art

--

High King of heaven, my victory won
May I reach heavens joys
O bright heavens sun!
Heart of my own heart whatever befall
Still be my vision O ruler of all

Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing
--

Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

--

Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the mount I'm fixed upon it
Mount of Thy redeeming love

--

Here I raise my Ebenezer
Hither by Thy help I'm come
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home

--

Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wandering from the fold of God
He, to rescue me from danger
Interposed His precious blood

--

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee

--

Prone to wander Lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart O take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above

--
The Love of Christ is Rich and Free
--

The love of Christ is rich and free
Fixed on His own eternally
Nor earth, nor hell, can it remove
Long as He lives, His own He’ll love

--

His loving heart engaged to be 
Their everlasting Surety
’Twas love that took their cause in hand
And love maintains it to the end 

--

Love cannot from its post withdraw
Nor death, nor hell, nor sin, nor law
Can turn the Surety’s heart away 
He’ll love His own to endless day

--

Love has redeemed His sheep with blood
And love will bring them safe to God
Love calls them all from death to life
And love will finish all their strife

--

He loves through every changing scene
Nor aught from Him can Zion wean 
Not all the wanderings of her heart 
Can make His love for her depart

--

Love cannot from its post withdraw
Nor death, nor hell, nor sin, nor law 
Can turn the Surety’s heart away
He’ll love His own to endless day

--

At death, beyond the grave, He’ll love
In endless bliss, His own shall prove 
The blazing glory of that love 
Which never could from them remove

Jesus Paid It All
--

And I hear the Savior say
"Thy strength indeed is small
Child of weakness watch and pray
Find in Me thine all in all"

--

'Cause Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow
(It's washed away)
(All my sin and all my shame)

--

Lord now indeed I find
Thy pow'r and Thine alone
Can change the leper's spots
And melt the heart of stone

--

'Cause Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow
(It's washed away)
(All my sin and all my shame)

--

And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete
Jesus died my soul to save
My lips shall still repeat

--

Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow (3x)

--

Oh praise the One Who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead

Jesus
