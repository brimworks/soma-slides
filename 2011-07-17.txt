In Christ Alone
--

In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm

--

What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
My Comforter, my All in All
Here in the love of Christ I stand

--

In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save

--

Till on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

--

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again

--

And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

--

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny

--

No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand


--
To Him Who Sits on the Throne
--

To Him who sits on the Throne
And unto the Lamb

Be blessing and Glory and
Honor and Power forever

--
Indescribable
--

From the highest of heights
to the depths of the sea
Creation's revealing Your majesty
From the colors of Fall
to the fragrance of Spring
Every creature unique in the
song that it sings
All exclaiming

--

Indescribable, Uncontainable,
You placed the stars in the sky
and You know them by name
You are amazing, God

All powerful, Untamable,
Awestruck we fall to our knees
as we humbly proclaim
You are amazing, God

--

Who has told every lightning
bolt where it should go
Or seen heavenly store
houses laden with snow
Who imagined the Sun and
gives source to its light
Yet conceals it to bring us
the coolness of night,

None can fathom

--

Indescribable, Uncontainable,
You placed the stars in the sky
and You know them by name
You are amazing, God

All powerful, Untamable,
Awestruck we fall to our knees
as we humbly proclaim
You are amazing, God

--

Incomparable, Unchangeable,

You see the depths of my
heart and you love me the same

You are amazing God
You are amazing God

--

Indescribable, Uncontainable,
You placed the stars in the sky
and You know them by name
You are amazing, God

All powerful, Untamable,
Awestruck we fall to our knees
as we humbly proclaim
You are amazing, God

Wonderful Maker
--

You spread out the skies over empty space 
You said "Let there be light"
Into a dark and formless world Your light was born

--

You spread out  Your arms over empty hearts 
You said "Let there be light"
Into a dark and hopeless world Your Son was born

You made the world and saw that it was good
You sent Your only son for You are good

No eye has fully seen, how beautiful the cross
And we have only heard
The faintest whispers of how great You are

You made the world and saw that it was good
You sent Your only son for You are good

What a wonderful Savior
How majestic Your whispers,
And how humble Your love

And the heart of a Father
How majestic Your whispers,

I'll Fly Away
--

Some glad morning when this life is over,
I'll fly away
To a land on God's celestial shore,
I'll fly away

--

I'll fly away oh glory, I'll fly away
When I die hallelujah by and by,
I'll fly away

--

When the shadows of this life have gone,
I'll fly away
Like a bird from prison walls has flown,
I'll fly away

--

I'll fly away oh glory, I'll fly away
When I die hallelujah by and by,
I'll fly away

--

Oh how glad and happy when we meet,
I'll fly away
No more cold iron shackles on my feet,
I'll fly away

--

I'll fly away oh glory, I'll fly away
When I die hallelujah by and by,
I'll fly away

--

Just a few more weary days and then,
I'll fly away
To a land where joy shall never end,
I'll fly away

--

I'll fly away oh glory, I'll fly away
When I die hallelujah by and by,
I'll fly away
