O For a Thousand Tongues
--

O, for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer praise
The glories of my God and King
The triumphs of His grace

--

My gracious Master and my God
Assist me to proclaim
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honors of Thy name

--

Jesus! The name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease,
Tis music in the sinner ears,
Tis life and health and peace.

--

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

--

He breaks the power of cancelled sin
He sets the prisoners free
His blood can make the foulest clean
His blood availed for me

--

Here Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb,
Your loosened tongues employ;
Ye blind, behold your Savior come;
And leap, ye lame, for joy.

--

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

--

Glory to God and praise and love
Be ever, ever given
By saints below and saints above
The church in earth and Heaven

--

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

--
Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing
--

Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

--

Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the mount I'm fixed upon it
Mount of Thy redeeming love

--

Here I raise my Ebenezer
Hither by Thy help I'm come
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home

--

Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wandering from the fold of God
He, to rescue me from danger
Interposed His precious blood

--

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee

--

Prone to wander Lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart O take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above

The Solid Rock
--

My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus’ blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus’ name

--


On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When darkness veils His lovely face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

His oath, His covenant, His blood
Support me in the whelming flood
When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my hope and stay

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh, may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the throne

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--
Nothing but the Blood
--

What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow.
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

For my pardon, this I see,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
For my cleansing this my plea,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow.
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

Nothing can for sin atone,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
Naught of good that I have done,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow.
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

This is all my hope and peace.
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
This is all my righteousness.
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow.
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--
Jesus Paid it All
--

I hear the Savior say,
Thy Strength indeed is small                  
Child of weakness watch and pray
Find in Me thine all in all
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
My sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy power and Thine alone          
Can change the lepers spots
And melt the heart of stone   
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
My sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete          
Jesus died my soul to save,
My lips shall still repeat   
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
My sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

O praise the one who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead
