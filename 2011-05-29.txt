O For a Thousand Tongues
--

O, for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer's praise
The glories of my God and King
The triumphs of His grace

--

My gracious Master and my God
Assist me to proclaim
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honors of Thy name

--

So come on and sing out
Let our anthem grow loud
There is one great love Jesus

--

Jesus! The name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease,
Tis music in the sinnerâ€™s ears,
Tis life and health and peace.

--

He breaks the power of cancelled sin
He sets the prisoners free
His blood can make the foulest clean
His blood availed for me

--

So come on and sing out
Let our anthem grow loud
There is one great love Jesus

--

He speaks and listening to His voice
New life the dead receive
The mournful broken hearts rejoice
The humble poor believe

--

Glory to God and praise and love
Be ever, ever given
By saints below and saints above
The church in earth and Heaven

--

So come on and sing out
Let our anthem grow loud
There is one great love Jesus

--
Holy is the Lord

We stand and lift up our hands
For the joy of the Lord is our strength
We bow down and worship Him now
How great how awesome is He
And together we sing
Everyone sing

Holy is the Lord God Almighty
The earth is filled with His glory
Holy is the Lord God Almighty
The earth is filled with His glory
The earth is filled with His glory

We stand and lift up our hands
For the joy of the Lord is our strength
We bow down and worship Him now
How great, how awesome is He
And together we sing
Everyone sing

Holy is the Lord God Almighty
The earth is filled with His glory
Holy is the Lord God Almighty
The earth is filled with His glory
The earth is filled with His glory

It's rising up all around
It's the anthem of the Lord's renown

--

And together we sing
Everyone sing
Holy is the Lord God Almighty
The earth is filled with His glory
Holy is the Lord God Almighty
The earth is filled with His glory
The earth is filled with His glory

The earth is filled with His glory
Holy, holy is the Lord Almighty, holy, holy

Be Thou My Vision
--

Be Thou my vision O Lord of my heart
Nought be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best thought by day or by night
Waking or sleeping Thy presence my light

--

Be Thou my Wisdom and Thou my true Word
I ever with Thee and Thou with me Lord
Thou my great Father I Thy true son
Thou in me dwelling and I with Thee one

--

Riches I heed not nor mans empty praise
Thou mine inheritance now and always
Thou and Thou only first in my heart
High King of heaven my treasure Thou art

--

High King of heaven, my victory won
May I reach heavens joys
O bright heavens sun!
Heart of my own heart whatever befall
Still be my vision O ruler of all

--
Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing
--

Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

--

Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the name I'm fixed upon it
Name of God's redeeming love

--

Hither to Thy love has blest me
Thou hast brought me to this place
And I know Thy hand will bring me
Safely home by Thy good grace

--

Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wand'ring from the fold of God
He to rescue me from danger
Bought me with His precious blood

--

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee

--

Prone to wander Lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart O take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above

--
Your Love Is Strong
--

Heavenly Father
You always amaze me
Let your kingdom come
In my world and in my life

--

Give me the food I need
To live through today
And forgive me as I forgive
The people that wronged me

--

Lead me far from temptation
Deliver me from the evil one

--

I look out the window
The birds are composing
Not a note is out of tune
Or out of place

--

I look at the meadow
And stare at the flowers
Better dressed than any girl
On her wedding day

--

So why do I worry?
Why do I freak out?
God knows what I need
You know what I need

--

Your love is
Your love is
Your love is strong

--

The kingdom of the heavens
Is now advancing
Invade my heart
Invade this broken town

--

The kingdom of the heavens
Is buried treasure
Will you sell yourself
To buy the one you've found?

--

Two things you told me
That you are strong
And you love me
Yes, you love me

--

Your love is
Your love is
Your love is strong

--

Oh God in heaven
Hallowed be
Thy name above all names
Your kingdom come
Your will be done
On earth as it is in heaven

--

Give us today our daily bread
Forgive us weary sinners
Lead us far from our vices
And deliver us from these prisons

--
Our God
--

Water you turned into wine,
opened the eyes of the blind
there's no one like you, none like You!

--

Into the darkness you shine
out of the ashes we rise
there's no one like you, none like You!

--

Our God is greater, our God is stronger,
God you are higher than any other.
Our God is Healer, Awesome in Power,
Our God! Our God!

--

Water you turned into wine,
opened the eyes of the blind
there's no one like you, none like You!

--

Into the darkness you shine
out of the ashes we rise
there's no one like you, none like You!

--

Our God is greater, our God is stronger,
God you are higher than any other.
Our God is Healer, Awesome in Power,
Our God! Our God!

--

And if our God is for us,
then who could ever stop us.
And if our God is with us,
then what could stand against.

--

Our God is greater, our God is stronger,
God you are higher than any other.
Our God is Healer, Awesome in Power,
Our God! Our God!
