House Of God Forever 
--

God is my Shepherd
I won't be wanting,
I won't be wanting
He makes me rest
In fields of green by quiet streams

--

Even though I walk
Through the valley of death and dying
I will not fear
For You are with me,
You're always with me

--

Your Shepherd's staff comforts me
You are my feast in the presence of enemies
Surely goodness will follow me, follow me
In the House of God, forever

--

God is my Shepherd
I won't be wanting,
I won't be wanting
He makes me rest
In fields of green by quiet streams

--

Even though I walk
Through the valley of death and dying
I will not fear
For You are with me,
You're always with me

--

Your Shepherd's staff comforts me
You are my feast in the presence of enemies
Surely goodness will follow me, follow me
In the House of God, forever

--
Come Thou Fount Of Every Blessing
--

Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

--

Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above.
Praise the name I'm fixed upon it
Name of God's redeeming love.

--

Hither to thy love has blessed me
Thou hast brought me to this place
And I know thy hand will bring
Me safely home by thy good grace.

--

Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wandering from the fold of God;
He, to rescue me from danger,
Bought me with his precious blood.

--

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee

--

Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
Prone to leave the God I love;
Here's my heart, O take and seal it;
Seal it for Thy courts above.

--

Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

--
Our God
--

Water you turned into wine,
opened the eyes of the blind
there's no one like you, none like You!

--

Into the darkness you shine
out of the ashes we rise
there's no one like you, none like You!

--

Our God is greater, our God is stronger,
God you are higher than any other.
Our God is Healer, Awesome in Power,
Our God! Our God!

--

Water you turned into wine,
opened the eyes of the blind
there's no one like you, none like You!

--

Into the darkness you shine
out of the ashes we rise
there's no one like you, none like You!

--

Our God is greater, our God is stronger,
God you are higher than any other.
Our God is Healer, Awesome in Power,
Our God! Our God!

--

And if our God is for us,
then who could ever stop us.
And if our God is with us,
then what could stand against.

--

Our God is greater, our God is stronger,
God you are higher than any other.
Our God is Healer, Awesome in Power,
Our God! Our God!

Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

Amen (4x)
