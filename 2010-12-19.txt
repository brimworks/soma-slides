Come Thou Long-Expected Jesus
--

Come, Thou long expected Jesus
Born to set Thy people free
From our fears and sins release us
Let us find our rest in Thee

--

Israel's Strength and Consolation
Hope of all the earth Thou art
Dear Desire of every nation
Joy of every longing heart

--

Born Thy people to deliver
Born a child and yet a King
Born to reign in us forever
Now Thy gracious kingdom bring

--

By Thine own eternal Spirit
Rule in all our hearts alone
By Thine all sufficient merit
Raise us to Thy glorious throne

--
What Child is This?
--

What Child is this who, laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
While shepherds watch are keeping?

--

This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing;
Haste, haste, to bring Him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary.

--

Why lies He in such mean estate,
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christians, fear, for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading.

--

This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing;
Haste, haste, to bring Him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary.

--

So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh,
Come peasant, king to own Him;
The King of kings salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.

--

Raise, raise a song on high,
The virgin sings her lullaby.
Joy, joy for Christ is born,
The Babe, the Son of Mary.

--
O come, O come, Emmanuel
--

O come, O come, Emmanuel,
And ransom captive Israel,
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear.

--

Rejoice! Rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.

--

O come, O come, Thou Lord of might,
Who to Thy tribes on Sinai's height
In ancient times didst give the law
In cloud and majesty and awe.

--

Rejoice! Rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.

--

O come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free
Thine own from Satan's tyranny;
From depths of hell Thy people save,
And give them vict'ry o'er the grave.

--

Rejoice! Rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.

--

O come, Thou Day-spring, come and cheer
Our spirits by Thine advent here;
O drive away the shades of night
And pierce the clouds and bring us light. 

--

Rejoice! Rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.

--

O come, Thou Key of David, come,
And open wide our heavenly home;
Where all Thy saints with Thee shall dwell--
O come, O come, Emmanuel

--
Silent Night
--

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin, mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

--

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born

--

Silent night, holy night
Son of God, loves pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth

Angels, From the Realms of Glory
--

Angels, from the realms of glory,
Wing your flight o'er all the earth;
Ye who sang creation's story,
Now proclaim Messiah's birth:

--

Come and worship, Come and worship,
Worship Christ the newborn King!

--

Shepherds, in the fields abiding,
Watching o'er your flocks by night,
God with us is now residing,
Yonder shines the infant Light:

--

Come and worship, Come and worship,
Worship Christ the newborn King!

--

Sages, leave your contemplations,
Brighter visions beam afar;
Seek the great Desire of Nations;
Ye have seen His natal star:

--

Come and worship, Come and worship,
Worship Christ the newborn King!

--

Saints, before the altar bending,
Watching long in hope and fear,
Suddenly the Lord, descending,
In His temple shall appear:

--
Hark! The Herald Angels Sing!
--

Hark the herald angels sing 
"Glory to the new born King
Peace on earth and mercy mild  
God and sinners reconciled"
Joyful all ye nations rise

--

Join the triumph of the skies
With angelic host proclaim  
"Christ is born in Bethlehem"
Hark the herald angels sing 
"Glory to the new born King"

--

Christ, by highest heaven adored;
Christ the everlasting Lord;
Late in time behold him come,
Offspring of the virgin's womb.
Veiled in flesh, the Godhead see;

--

hail the incarnate Deity
Pleased as man with men to dwell,
Jesus, our Immanuel
Hark the herald angels sing,
"Glory to the new born King"

--

Hail! the heaven-born Prince of Peace.
Hail the son of Righteousness
Light and life to all He brings,
risen with healing in His wings
Mild He lays His glory by,

--

born that man no more may die
Born to raise the sons of earth,
born to give them second birth
Hark the herald angels sing,
"Glory to the new born King"
