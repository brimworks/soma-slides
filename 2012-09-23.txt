Your Love Never Fails
--

Nothing can separate
Even if I ran away
Your love never fails

--

I know I still make mistakes
But You have new mercies for me everyday
Your love never fails

--

You stay the same through the ages
Your love never changes
There may be pain in the night
But joy comes in the morning

--

And when the oceans rage
I don't have to be afraid
Because I know that You love me
Your love never fails

--

The wind is strong and the water's deep
But I'm not alone here in these open seas
Cause Your love never fails

--

The chasm is far too wide
I never thought I'd reach the other side
But Your love never fails

--

You stay the same through the ages
Your love never changes
There may be pain in the night
But joy comes in the morning

--

And when the oceans rage
I don't have to be afraid
Because I know that You love me
Your love never fails

--

You make all things
work together for my good
(6x)

--

You stay the same through the ages
Your love never changes
There may be pain in the night
But joy comes in the morning

--

And when the oceans rage
I don't have to be afraid
Because I know that You love me
Your love never fails

Beautiful Things
--

All this pain
I wonder if I'll ever find my way
I wonder if my life could really change
At all

--

All this earth
Could all that is lost ever be found
Could a garden come up from this ground
At all

--

You make beautiful things
You make beautiful things out of the dust
You make beautiful things
You make beautiful things out of us

--

All around
Hope is springing up from this old ground
Out of chaos life is being found
In You

--

You make beautiful things
You make beautiful things out of the dust
You make beautiful things
You make beautiful things out of us

--

You make me new, You are making me new
You make me new, You are making me new

--

You make beautiful things
You make beautiful things out of the dust
You make beautiful things
You make beautiful things out of us

Message

Message

How Deep the Father's Love for Us
--

How deep the Father's love for us
How vast beyond all measure
That He should give His only Son
And make a wretch His treasure

--

How great the pain of searing loss
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the chosen One
Bring many sons to glory

--

Behold the Man upon the cross
My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers 

--

It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished

--

I will not boast in anything
No gifts, no power, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection

--

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom

--
In Christ Alone
--

In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm

--

What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
My Comforter, my All in All
Here in the love of Christ I stand

--

In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save

--

Till on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

--

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again

--

And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

--

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny

--

No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand

--
