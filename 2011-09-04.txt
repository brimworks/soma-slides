In Christ Alone
--

In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm

--

What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
My Comforter, my All in All
Here in the love of Christ I stand

--

In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save

--

Till on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

--

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again

--

And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

--

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny

--

No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand

--
Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing
--

Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

--

Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the mount I'm fixed upon it
Mount of Thy redeeming love

--

Here I raise my Ebenezer
Hither by Thy help I'm come
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home

--

Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wandering from the fold of God
He, to rescue me from danger
Interposed His precious blood

--

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee

--

Prone to wander Lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart O take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above

Sermon

Sermon

--
How Deep the Father's Love for Us
--

How deep the Father's love for us
How vast beyond all measure
That He would give His only Son
To make a wretch His treasure

--

How great the pain of searing loss
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the chosen One
Bring many sons to glory

--

Behold the Man upon a cross
My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers 

--

It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished

--

I will not boast in anything
No gifts, no powers, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection

--

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom

--
Psalm 27
--

The Lord is the light of my Salvation,
The Lord is the strength of my life,
Whom shall I fear, of whom shall I be afraid,
Whom shall I fear, O Lord
Whom shall I fear, whom shall I fear,
Of whom shall I be afraid?

--
House of God Forever
--

God is my Shepherd
I won't be wanting,
I won't be wanting
He makes me rest
In fields of green by quiet streams

--

Even though I walk
Through the valley of death and dying
I will not fear
For You are with me,
You're always with me

--

Your Shepherd's staff comforts me
You are my feast in the presence of enemies
Surely goodness will follow me, follow me
In the House of God, forever

--

God is my Shepherd
I won't be wanting,
I won't be wanting
He makes me rest
In fields of green by quiet streams

--

Even though I walk
Through the valley of death and dying
I will not fear
For You are with me,
You're always with me

--

Your Shepherd's staff comforts me
You are my feast in the presence of enemies
Surely goodness will follow me, follow me
In the House of God, forever
