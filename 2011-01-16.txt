Holy is the Lord
--

We stand and lift up our hands         
For the joy of the Lord is our strength
We bow down and worship Him now                      
How great how awesome is He
And together we sing

--

Holy is the Lord God Almighty   
The earth is filled with His glory  
Holy is the Lord God Almighty   
The earth is filled with His glory   
The earth is filled with His glory

We stand and lift up our hands   
For the joy of the Lord is our strength  
We bow down and worship Him now   
How great, how awesome is He
And together we sing   
Everyone sing

Holy is the Lord God Almighty 
The earth is filled with His glory   
Holy is the Lord God Almighty   
The earth is filled with His glory

It's the anthem of the Lord's renown

Great is Thy Faithfulness
--

Great is Thy faithfulness O God my Father 
There is no shadow of turning with Thee
Thou changest not Thy compassions they fail not 
As Thou hast been Thou forever wilt be

--

Great is Thy faithfulness  
Great is Thy faithfulness  

Morning by morning new mercies I see 
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided
Great is Thy faithfulness Lord unto  me

--

Summer and winter and springtime and harvest
Sun, moon and stars in their courses above
Join with all nature in manifold witness
To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love

--

Great is Thy faithfulness  
Great is Thy faithfulness  

Morning by morning new mercies I see 
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided
Great is Thy faithfulness Lord unto  me

Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth
Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide
Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow
Blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside

Great is Thy faithfulness

Morning by morning new mercies I see 
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided
Great is Thy faithfulness Lord unto  me

Psalm 27
--

The Lord is the light of my Salvation,
The Lord is the strength of my life,
Whom shall I fear, of whom shall I be afraid,
Whom shall I fear, O Lord
Whom shall I fear, whom shall I fear,
Of whom shall I be afraid?

The Solid Rock
--

My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus’ blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus’ name

--


On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When darkness veils His lovely face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

His oath, His covenant, His blood
Support me in the whelming flood
When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my hope and stay

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh, may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the throne

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--
O For a Thousand Tongues
--

O, for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer’s praise
The glories of my God and King
The triumphs of His grace

--

My gracious Master and my God
Assist me to proclaim
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honors of Thy name

--

Jesus! The name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease,
‘Tis music in the sinner’s ears,
‘Tis life and health and peace.

--

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

--

He breaks the power of cancelled sin
He sets the prisoners free
His blood can make the foulest clean
His blood availed for me

--

Here Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb,
Your loosened tongues employ;
Ye blind, behold your Savior come;
And leap, ye lame, for joy.

--

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

--

Glory to God and praise and love
Be ever, ever given
By saints below and saints above
The church in earth and Heaven

--

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

--
The Love of Christ is Rich and Free
--

The love of Christ is rich and free; 
Fixed on His own eternally; 
Nor earth, nor hell, can it remove; 
Long as He lives, His own He’ll love.


--

His loving heart engaged to be 
Their everlasting Surety; 
’Twas love that took their cause in hand, 
And love maintains it to the end.  

--

Love cannot from its post withdraw; 
Nor death, nor hell, nor sin, nor law, 
Can turn the Surety’s heart away; 
He’ll love His own to endless day. 

--

Love has redeemed His sheep with blood; 
And love will bring them safe to God; 
Love calls them all from death to life; 
And love will finish all their strife. 

--

He loves through every changing scene, 
Nor aught from Him can Zion wean; 
Not all the wanderings of her heart 
Can make His love for her depart.

--

Love cannot from its post withdraw; 
Nor death, nor hell, nor sin, nor law, 
Can turn the Surety’s heart away; 
He’ll love His own to endless day.

--

At death, beyond the grave, He’ll love; 
In endless bliss, His own shall prove 
The blazing glory of that love 
Which never could from them remove.
