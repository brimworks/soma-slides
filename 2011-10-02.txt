How Great is Our God
--

The splendor of a King
clothed in Majesty
Let all the earth rejoice
All the earth rejoice

--

He wraps Himself in light
and darkness tries to hide
And trembles at His voice
Trembles at His voice

--

How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, all will see
How great, how great is our God

--

Age to age He stands
and time is in His hands
Beginning and the end
Beginning and the end

--

The Godhead, three in one
Father, Spirit, Son
The Lion and the Lamb
The Lion and the Lamb

--

How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, all will see
How great, how great is our God

--

Name above all names
Worthy of all Praise
My heart will sing
How great is our God
(2x)

--

How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, all will see
How great, how great is our God

Sermon

Be Thou My Vision
--

Be Thou my vision O Lord of my heart
Nought be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best thought by day or by night
Waking or sleeping Thy presence my light

--

Be Thou my Wisdom and Thou my true Word
I ever with Thee and Thou with me Lord
Thou my great Father I Thy true son
Thou in me dwelling and I with Thee one

--

Riches I heed not nor mans empty praise
Thou mine inheritance now and always
Thou and Thou only first in my heart
High King of heaven my treasure Thou art

--

High King of heaven, my victory won
May I reach heavens joys
O bright heavens sun!
Heart of my own heart whatever befall
Still be my vision O ruler of all

--
My God My Father
--

My God, my Father while I stray
Far from my home in life's rough way
O teach me from my heart to say
Thy will be done

--

Though dark my path, and sad my lot
Let me be still, and murmur not
O breathe the prayer divinely taught
Thy will be done!

--

But if my fainting heart be blessed
With the Holy Spirit for its guest
My God to Thee I leave the rest
Thy will be done!

--

If Thou should call me to resign
What most I prize, never was mine
I only yield Thee what is Thine
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!

--

Renew my will from day to day
Blend it with Thine and take away
All that now makes it hard to say
Thy will be done!

--

Then when on earth I breathe no more
The prayer oft mixed with tears before
I'll sing upon that joyful shore
Thy will be done!

--

Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!

Your Love Is Strong
--

Heavenly Father
You always amaze me
Let your kingdom come
In my world and in my life

--

Give me the food I need
To live through today
And forgive me as I forgive
The people that wronged me

--

Lead me far from temptation
Deliver me from the evil one

--

I look out the window
The birds are composing
Not a note is out of tune
Or out of place

--

I look at the meadow
And stare at the flowers
Better dressed than any girl
On her wedding day

--

So why do I worry?
Why do I freak out?
God knows what I need
You know what I need

--

Your love is
Your love is
Your love is strong

--

The kingdom of the heavens
Is now advancing
Invade my heart
Invade this broken town

--

The kingdom of the heavens
Is buried treasure
Will you sell yourself
To buy the one you've found?

--

Two things you told me
That you are strong
And you love me
Yes, you love me

--

Your love is
Your love is
Your love is strong

--

Oh God in heaven
Hallowed be
Thy name above all names
Your kingdom come
Your will be done
On earth as it is in heaven

--

Give us today our daily bread
Forgive us weary sinners
Lead us far from our vices
And deliver us from these prisons

--
Doxology
--

Praise God, from Whom all blessings flow;
Praise Him, all creatures here below;
Praise Him above, ye heavenly host;
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

Amen (4x)
