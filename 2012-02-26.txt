Your Love Never Fails
--

Nothing can separate
Even if I ran away
Your love never fails

--

I know I still make mistakes
But You have new mercies for me everyday
Your love never fails

--

You stay the same through the ages
Your love never changes
There may be pain in the night
But joy comes in the morning

--

And when the oceans rage
I don't have to be afraid
Because I know that You love me
Your love never fails

--

The wind is strong and the water's deep
But I'm not alone here in these open seas
Cause Your love never fails

--

The chasm is far too wide
I never thought I'd reach the other side
But Your love never fails

--

You stay the same through the ages
Your love never changes
There may be pain in the night
But joy comes in the morning

--

And when the oceans rage
I don't have to be afraid
Because I know that You love me
Your love never fails

--

You make all things
work together for my good
(6x)

--

You stay the same through the ages
Your love never changes
There may be pain in the night
But joy comes in the morning

--

And when the oceans rage
I don't have to be afraid
Because I know that You love me
Your love never fails

--
Thy Mercy, My God
--

Thy mercy my God is the theme of my song
The joy of my heart, and the boast of my tongue
Thy free grace alone, from the first to the last
Hath won my affection and bound my soul fast

--

Without Thy sweet mercy, I could not live here
Sin would reduce me to utter despair
But through Thy free goodness, my spirit's revived
And He that first made me still keeps me alive

--


Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
Merciful God

--

Thy mercy is more than a match for my heart
Which wonders to feel its own hardness depart
Dissolved by Thy goodness, I fall to the ground
And weep for the praise of the mercy I've found

--

Great Father of mercies, Thy goodness I own
In the covenant love of Thy crucified Son
All praise to the Spirit, Whose whisper divine
Seals mercy and pardon and righteousness mine
All praise to the Spirit, Whose whisper divine
Seals mercy and pardon and righteousness mine

--


Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
Merciful God
(2x)

--

All praise to the Spirit, Whose whisper divine
Seals mercy and pardon and righteousness mine
(2X)

In The Shadow Of The Glorious Cross
--

In the shadow of the glorious cross
Compelled by grace to cast my lot
I'll discard the loss and bare your name
Forsaking all for your own fame

--

Your hymn of grace sung over me
Abounding forth in glorious streams
My thirst is quenched by you my Lord
Sustained am I redeemed restored
Sustained am I redeemed restored
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

--

When death's dark shadow's at my feet
When I am plagued by unbelief
You place my hands into your side
By precious blood identified
By precious blood identified
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

--

These crowns I've clenched with fisted hands
I cast them down before your throne
Of Christ my God the worthy lamb
Christ crucified, the Great I AM. (3x)
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

--
In Christ Alone
--

In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm

--

What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
My Comforter, my All in All
Here in the love of Christ I stand

--

In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save

--

Till on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

--

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again

--

And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

--

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny

--

No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand

--
