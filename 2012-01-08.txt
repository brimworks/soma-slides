Indescribable
--

From the highest of heights
to the depths of the sea
Creation's revealing Your majesty
From the colors of Fall
to the fragrance of Spring
Every creature unique in the
song that it sings
All exclaiming

--

Indescribable, Uncontainable,
You placed the stars in the sky
and You know them by name
You are amazing, God

All powerful, Untamable,
Awestruck we fall to our knees
as we humbly proclaim
You are amazing, God

--

Who has told every lightning
bolt where it should go
Or seen heavenly store
houses laden with snow
Who imagined the Sun and
gives source to its light
Yet conceals it to bring us
the coolness of night,

None can fathom

--

Indescribable, Uncontainable,
You placed the stars in the sky
and You know them by name
You are amazing, God

All powerful, Untamable,
Awestruck we fall to our knees
as we humbly proclaim
You are amazing, God

--

Incomparable, Unchangeable,

You see the depths of my
heart and you love me the same

You are amazing God
You are amazing God

--

Indescribable, Uncontainable,
You placed the stars in the sky
and You know them by name
You are amazing, God

All powerful, Untamable,
Awestruck we fall to our knees
as we humbly proclaim
You are amazing, God

Sermon

Be Thou My Vision
--

Be Thou my vision O Lord of my heart
Nought be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best thought by day or by night
Waking or sleeping Thy presence my light

--

Be Thou my Wisdom and Thou my true Word
I ever with Thee and Thou with me Lord
Thou my great Father I Thy true son
Thou in me dwelling and I with Thee one

--

Riches I heed not nor mans empty praise
Thou mine inheritance now and always
Thou and Thou only first in my heart
High King of heaven my treasure Thou art

--

High King of heaven, my victory won
May I reach heavens joys
O bright heavens sun!
Heart of my own heart whatever befall
Still be my vision O ruler of all

--
In Christ Alone
--

In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm

--

What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
My Comforter, my All in All
Here in the love of Christ I stand

--

In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save

--

Till on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

--

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again

--

And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

--

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny

--

No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand

--
Our God
--

Water you turned into wine,
opened the eyes of the blind
there's no one like you, none like You!

--

Into the darkness you shine
out of the ashes we rise
there's no one like you, none like You!

--

Our God is greater, our God is stronger,
God you are higher than any other.
Our God is Healer, Awesome in Power,
Our God! Our God!

--

Water you turned into wine,
opened the eyes of the blind
there's no one like you, none like You!

--

Into the darkness you shine
out of the ashes we rise
there's no one like you, none like You!

--

Our God is greater, our God is stronger,
God you are higher than any other.
Our God is Healer, Awesome in Power,
Our God! Our God!

--

And if our God is for us,
then who could ever stop us.
And if our God is with us,
then what could stand against.

--

Our God is greater, our God is stronger,
God you are higher than any other.
Our God is Healer, Awesome in Power,
Our God! Our God!

The Solid Rock
--

My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus' name

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When darkness veils His lovely face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

His oath, His covenant, His blood
Support me in the whelming flood
When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my hope and stay

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh, may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the throne

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand
