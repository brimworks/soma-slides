Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing
--

Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

--

Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the name I'm fixed upon it
Name of God's redeeming love

--

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee

--

Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart, O take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above

--

Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

--
How Great is Our God
--

The splendor of a King
clothed in Majesty
Let all the earth rejoice
All the earth rejoice

--

He wraps Himself in light
and darkness tries to hide
And trembles at His voice
Trembles at His voice

--

How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, all will see
How great, how great is our God

--

Age to age He stands
and time is in His hands
Beginning and the end
Beginning and the end

--

The Godhead, three in one
Father, Spirit, Son
The Lion and the Lamb
The Lion and the Lamb

--

How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, all will see
How great, how great is our God

--

Name above all names
Worthy of all Praise
My heart will sing
How great is our God
(2x)

--

How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, all will see
How great, how great is our God

A Prayer for Faith
--

My Heart is glad, that you are my Father
Adopted to you, as sons and daughters
And Your love endures, as You said it would
And my heart sings

--

Teach me, the sound of Your voice
With the faith to respond, to love you
Teach me, to follow you close
With the faith you bestow, to love you

--

My heart is glad, to serve you as King
Forgive the times, that I am stubborn
With a humble heart, may I come to you
And my heart sings

--

Teach me, the sound of Your voice
With the faith to respond, to love you
Teach me, to follow you close
With the faith you bestow, to love you

--
King of All Glory
--

Who can stand next to Your majesty?
Next to Your holiness, who can stand?
What compares, faced with Your righteousness?
Faced with Your promises, what compares?

--

Here we are, by Your grace we stand
Matchless King, we've come to sing

--

Holy are You, Lord
King of all glory,
we have come to honor You
Holy are You, Lord
Heaven and earth ring,
singing Hallelujah

Holy

The Glory of God
--

What can I give unto You, my Lord 
For You are of infinite worth. 
The sum of my songs, the cry of my heart 
The breath that descends to earth 

--

The deepest parts of the universe 
Are not strangers to Your hand 
The highest mountains, the furthest of seas 
The forgotten and untold lands 

--

There’s a song that is sung 
By the saints that have come
and have gone from under the sun 
Those that are present 
Before your throne sing endlessly...
the glory of God!!! 

--

Praise and glory and wisdom and thanks 
And honor and power and strength 
Be to our God forever and ever and ever, Amen. 

--

What can I give unto You, my Lord 
For You are of infinite worth. 
The sum of my songs, the cry of my heart 
The breath that descends to earth 

--

What cry can the deepest of sorrow bring 
That You do not well understand? 
What laugh can the outburst of joy not sing 
Of the providence brought by Your hand? 

--

The deepest parts of the universe 
Are not strangers to Your hand 
The highest mountains, the furthest of seas 
The forgotten and untold lands 

--

There’s a song that is sung 
By the saints that have come
and have gone from under the sun 
Those that are present 
Before your throne sing endlessly...
the glory of God!!! 

--

Praise and glory and wisdom and thanks 
And honor and power and strength 
Be to our God forever and ever and ever, Amen.

Rain
--

When I wake, You're there
When I run, You run for me
When I call, You listen

--

Just to believe that You want me
Makes me think
I'm bound to know You

--

Rain down on me
Give me the eyes to see
Rain down on me
And I will believe

--

When I wake, You're there
When I run, You run for me
When I call, You listen

--

Just to believe that You want me
Makes me think
I'm bound to know You

--

Rain down on me
Give me the eyes to see
Rain down on me
And I will believe

--

Make my life a prayer to You
Lord to do what You want me to
Rain Your Spirit down on me

--

Rain down on me
Give me the eyes to see
Rain down on me
And I will believe

--

When I wake, You're there
When I run, You run for me
