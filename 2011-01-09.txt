Be Thou My Vision
--

Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart
Nought be all else to me, save that Thou are;
Thou my best thought, by day or by night
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

--

Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

--

Riches I heed not, nor man’s empty praise
Thou mine inheritance, now and always;
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart
High King of heaven, my Treasure Thou art.

--

High King of heaven, my victory won,
May I reach heaven’s joys, O bright heaven’s Sun!
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.

--
When I Survey the Wondrous Cross
--

When I survey the wondrous cross, 
On which the Prince of Glory died
My richest gain I count but loss, 
And pour contempt on all my pride.

--

See from His head, His hands, His feet, 
Sorrow and love flow mingled down:
Did ever such love and sorrow meet, 
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

--

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast, 
Save in the death of Christ my Lord;
All the vain things that charm me most, 
I sacrifice them to His blood.

--

Were the whole realm of nature mine, 
That were an offering far too small
Love so amazing, so divine, 
Demands my soul, my life, my all.

--

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast, 
Save in the death of Christ my Lord;
All the vain things that charm me most, 
I sacrifice them to His blood.

--

When I survey the wondrous cross, 
On which the Prince of Glory died
My richest gain I count but loss, 
And pour contempt on all my pride.

--
Better is One Day
--

How lovely is your dwelling place
Oh Lord Almighty 
My soul longs and even faints for You
For here my heart is satisfied  
Within your presence
I sing beneath the shadow of your wings

--

Better is one day in your courts
Better is one day in your house
Better is one day in your courts
Than thousands elsewhere

--

One thing I ask and I would seek
To see your beauty
To find you in the place your glory dwells

--

Better is one day in your courts
Better is one day in your house
Better is one day in your courts
Than thousands elsewhere

--

My heart and flesh cry out
For you the living God
Your spirit's water for my soul
I've tasted and I've seen
Come once again to me
I will draw near to you
I will draw near to you

--

Better is one day in your courts
Better is one day in your house
Better is one day in your courts
Than thousands elsewhere

--
Here I am To Worship
--

Light of the world 
You stepped down into darkness 
Opened my eyes, let me see 
Beauty that made this heart adore you
Hope of a life spent with You 

--

So here I am to worship 
Here I am to bow down 
Here I am to say that You're my all 
You're altogether lovely,
altogether worthy
You are altogether wonderful to me 

--

King of all days 
Oh so highly exalted 
Glorious in Heaven above 
Humbly You came to the earth You created 
All for love's sake became poor

--

So here I am to worship 
Here I am to bow down 
Here I am to say that You're my all 
You're altogether lovely,
altogether worthy
You are altogether wonderful to me 

--

I'll never know, how much it cost 
To see my sin upon that cross

--

So here I am to worship 
Here I am to bow down 
Here I am to say that You're my all 
You're altogether lovely,
altogether worthy
You are altogether wonderful to me 

--

Light of the world 
You stepped down into darkness 
Opened my eyes, let me see

--
Arms of Love
--

I sing a simple song of love
To my Savior, to my Jesus
I'm grateful for the things You've done
My loving Savior oh precious Jesus


--

My heart is glad that You've called me Your own
And there's no place I'd rather be


--

Than in Your arms of love
In Your arms of love
Holding me still holding me near
In Your arms of love

--

I sing a simple song of love
To my Savior, to my Jesus
I'm grateful for the things You've done
My loving Savior oh precious Jesus

--

My heart is glad that You've called me Your own
And there's no place I'd rather be

--

Than in Your arms of love
In Your arms of love
Holding me still holding me near
In Your arms of love

--
Jesus Paid it All
--

I hear the Savior say,
“Thy Strength indeed is small”                  
Child of weakness watch and pray
Find in Me thine all in all
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
Sin has left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy power and Thine alone          
Can change the leper’s spots
And melt the heart of stone   
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
Sin has left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete          
“Jesus died my soul to save”
My lips shall still repeat   
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
Sin has left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

O praise the one who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead
