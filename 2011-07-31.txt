Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing
--

Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

--

Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the name I'm fixed upon it
Name of God's redeeming love

--

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee

--

Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart, O take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above

--

Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

--
How Great is Our God
--

The splendor of a King
clothed in Majesty
Let all the earth rejoice
All the earth rejoice

--

He wraps Himself in light
and darkness tries to hide
And trembles at His voice
Trembles at His voice

--

How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, all will see
How great, how great is our God

--

Age to age He stands
and time is in His hands
Beginning and the end
Beginning and the end

--

The Godhead, three in one
Father, Spirit, Son
The Lion and the Lamb
The Lion and the Lamb

--

How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, all will see
How great, how great is our God

--

Name above all names
Worthy of all Praise
My heart will sing
How great is our God
(2x)

--

How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, all will see
How great, how great is our God

Thoughts of You
--

Thoughts of You and how You changed me 
Fill my mind 
Without You where would I be

--

So even though I've tried
to express my thanks 
It never comes out how I hoped 
I want to say so much more
so with these simple words I'll try

--

I love You 
My heart is Yours, only Yours 
I long to give You all of me 
My everything, my everything

--

You still loved me even when I 
Pushed You away 
You stood there and waited 
Till the day I'd return

--

God I never could repay You 
You gave everything 
Without You where would I be 

--

So even though I've tried
to express my thanks 
It never comes out how I hoped 
I want to say so much more
so with these simple words I'll try

--

I love You 
My heart is Yours, only Yours 
I long to give You all of me 
My everything, my everything

Blessed Be Your Name
--

Blessed be your name,
In the land that is plentiful
Where Your streams of abundance flow
Blessed be Your name

--

Blessed be your name
When I'm found in the desert place
Though I walk through the wilderness
Blessed be Your name 

--

Every blessing You pour out
I'll turn back to praise
When the darkness closes in Lord
Still I will say

--

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your way
My heart will always say,
Lord Blessed be your name

--

Blessed be your name
When the sun's shining down on me
When the world's all as it should be
Blessed be your name

--

Blessed be your name
On the road marked with suffering
Though there's pain in the offering
Blessed be your name

--

Every blessing You pour out I'll
turn back to praise
When the darkness closes in, Lord
Still I will say...

--

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your way
My heart will always say,
Lord Blessed be your name

--

You give and take away
You give and take away
My heart will always say
Lord Blessed be your name
(2x)

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your way
My heart will always say,
Lord Blessed be your name

Strong Tower
--

When I wander through the desert
And I'm longing for my home
All my dreams have gone astray
When I'm stranded in the valley
And I'm tired and all alone
It seems like I've lost my way

--

I go running to Your Mountain
Where your mercy sets me free...

--

You are my strong tower
Shelter over me
Beautiful and mighty
Everlasting King
You are my strong tower
Fortress when I'm weak
Your name is true and holy
And Your face is all I seek

--

In the middle of my darkness
In the midst of all my fear
You're my refuge and my hope
When the storm of life is raging
And the thunder's all I hear
You speak softly to my soul

--

I go running to Your Mountain
Where your mercy sets me free...

--

You are my strong tower
Shelter over me
Beautiful and mighty
Everlasting King
You are my strong tower
Fortress when I'm weak
Your name is true and holy
And Your face is all I seek

--

When I wander through the desert
And I'm longing for my home
All my dreams have gone astray
When I'm stranded in the valley
And I'm tired and all alone
It seems like I've lost my way

--

I go running to Your Mountain
Where your mercy sets me free...

--

You are my strong tower
Shelter over me
Beautiful and mighty
Everlasting King
You are my strong tower
Fortress when I'm weak
Your name is true and holy
And Your face is all I seek

--
My God My Father
--

My God, my Father while I stray
Far from my home in life's rough way
O teach me from my heart to say
Thy will be done

--

Though dark my path, and sad my lot
Let me be still, and murmur not
Or breathe the prayer divinely taught
Thy will be done!

--

But if my fainting heart be blessed
With the Holy Spirit for its guest
My God to Thee I leave the rest
Thy will be done!

--

If Thou should call me to resign
What most I prize, never was mine
I only yield Thee what is Thine
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!

--

Renew my will from day to day
Blend it with Thine and take away
All that now makes it hard to say
Thy will be done!
(2x)

--

Then when on earth I breathe no more
The prayer oft mixed with tears before
I'll sing upon that joyful shore
Thy will be done!

--

My God, my Father while I stray
Far from my home in life's rough way
O teach me from my heart to say
Thy will be done

--

Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
