Sermon

Man of Sorrows
--

Man of sorrows what a Name
For the Son of God Who came
Ruined sinners to reclaim
Hallelujah what a Saviour

--

Bearing shame 
and scoffing rude
In my place 
condemned He stood
Sealed my pardon 
with His Blood
Hallelujah what a Saviour

--

Guilty vile and helpless we
Spotless Lamb of God was He
Full atonement can it be
Hallelujah what a Saviour

--

Lifted up was He to die
It is finished was His Cry
Now in Heaven exalted high
Hallelujah what a Saviour

--

When He comes 
our Glorious King
All His ransomed home to bring
Then anew this song we'll sing
Hallelujah what a Saviour

--
Jesus Paid it All
--

I hear the Savior say,
Thy Strength indeed is small                  
Child of weakness watch and pray
Find in Me thine all in all
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
Sin has left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy power and Thine alone          
Can change the lepers spots
And melt the heart of stone   
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
Sin has left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete          
Jesus died my soul to save,
My lips shall still repeat   
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
Sin has left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

O praise the one who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead

--
Your Love Is Strong
--

Heavenly Father
You always amaze me
Let your kingdom come
In my world and in my life

--

Give me the food I need
To live through today
And forgive me as I forgive
The people that wronged me

--

Lead me far from temptation
Deliver me from the evil one

--

I look out the window
The birds are composing
Not a note is out of tune
Or out of place

--

I look at the meadow
And stare at the flowers
Better dressed than any girl
On her wedding day

--

So why do I worry?
Why do I freak out?
God knows what I need
You know what I need

--

Your love is
Your love is
Your love is strong

--

The kingdom of the heavens
Is now advancing
Invade my heart
Invade this broken town

--

The kingdom of the heavens
Is buried treasure
Will you sell yourself
To buy the one you've found?

--

Two things you told me
That you are strong
And you love me
Yes, you love me

--

Your love is
Your love is
Your love is strong

--

Oh God in heaven
Hallowed be
Thy name above all names
Your kingdom come
Your will be done
On earth as it is in heaven

--

Give us today our daily bread
Forgive us weary sinners
Lead us far from our vices
And deliver us from these prisons

--
House Of God Forever 
--

God is my Shepherd
I won't be wanting,
I won't be wanting
He makes me rest
In fields of green by quiet streams

--

Even though I walk
Through the valley of death and dying
I will not fear
For You are with me,
You're always with me

--

Your Shepherd's staff comforts me
You are my feast in the presence of enemies
Surely goodness will follow me, follow me
In the House of God, forever

--

God is my Shepherd
