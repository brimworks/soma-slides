Indescribable
--

From the highest of heights
to the depths of the sea
Creation's revealing Your majesty
From the colors of Fall
to the fragrance of Spring
Every creature unique in the
song that it sings
All exclaiming

--

Indescribable, Uncontainable,
You placed the stars in the sky
and You know them by name
You are amazing, God

All powerful, Untamable,
Awestruck we fall to our knees
as we humbly proclaim
You are amazing, God

--

Who has told every lightning
bolt where it should go
Or seen heavenly store
houses laden with snow
Who imagined the Sun and
gives source to its light
Yet conceals it to bring us
the coolness of night,

None can fathom

--

Indescribable, Uncontainable,
You placed the stars in the sky
and You know them by name
You are amazing, God

All powerful, Untamable,
Awestruck we fall to our knees
as we humbly proclaim
You are amazing, God

--

Incomparable, Unchangeable,

You see the depths of my
heart and you love me the same

You are amazing God
You are amazing God

--

Indescribable, Uncontainable,
You placed the stars in the sky
and You know them by name
You are amazing, God

All powerful, Untamable,
Awestruck we fall to our knees
as we humbly proclaim
You are amazing, God

Sermon

How Deep the Father's Love for Us
--

How deep the Father's love for us
How vast beyond all measure
That He should give His only Son
And make a wretch His treasure

--

How great the pain of searing loss
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the chosen One
Bring many sons to glory

--

Behold the Man upon the cross
My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers 

--

It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished

--

I will not boast in anything
No gifts, no power, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection

--

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom

--
In Christ Alone
--

In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm

--

What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
My Comforter, my All in All
Here in the love of Christ I stand

--

In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save

--

Till on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

--

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again

--

And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

--

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny

--

No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand

--
I Stand Amazed
--

I stand amazed in the presence,
Of Jesus the Nazarene 
And wonder how He could love me,
A sinner condemned unclean

--

How marvelous, how wonderful 
And my song shall ever be 
How marvelous, how wonderful 
Is my Savior's love for me

--

He took my sins and my sorrows
He made them His very own 
And bore my burden to Calvary
and suffered and died alone

--

How marvelous, how wonderful 
And my song shall ever be 
How marvelous, how wonderful 
Is my Savior's love for me

--

When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see 
Twill be my joy through the ages
to sing of His love for me

--

How marvelous, how wonderful 
And my song shall ever be 
How marvelous, how wonderful 
Is my Saviors love for me

--
Isaiah 60
--

Wake up Jerusalem
Put your face in the sunlight
God's Glory is breaking over you
Nations they're all coming
And exiles return home
The great reunion is at hand

--

Praises from the City of the Living God

--

Look out in the distance
Like doves on the darkened sky
Great ships from the distant land
Filled up with gold and silver
All the children they are coming back
God's glory is sailing to the shore

--

Praises from the City of the Living God

--

Strong is your name
Free is your new name
Peace is your name
Love is your new name
Faithful is your name
Gracious is your new name

--

Honest is your name
Wisdom is your new name
Overcoming one
Hidden in life of the chosen son
All because of Christ.
