Here I am To Worship
--

Light of the world 
You stepped down into darkness 
Opened my eyes, let me see 
Beauty that made this heart adore you
Hope of a life spent with You 

--

So here I am to worship 
Here I am to bow down 
Here I am to say that You're my God 
You're altogether lovely,
altogether worthy
You are altogether wonderful to me 

--

King of all days 
Oh so highly exalted 
Glorious in Heaven above 
Humbly You came to the earth You created 
All for love's sake became poor

--

So here I am to worship 
Here I am to bow down 
Here I am to say that You're my God 
You're altogether lovely,
altogether worthy
You are altogether wonderful to me 

--

I'll never know, how much it cost 
To see my sin upon that cross

--

So here I am to worship 
Here I am to bow down 
Here I am to say that You're my God 
You're altogether lovely,
altogether worthy
You are altogether wonderful to me

Light of the world 
You stepped down into darkness 
Opened my eyes, let me see

Blessed Be Your Name
--

Blessed be your name,
In the land that is plentiful
Where Your streams of abundance flow
Blessed be Your name

--

Blessed be your name
When I'm found in the desert place
Though I walk through the wilderness
Blessed be Your name 

--

Every blessing You pour out
I'll turn back to praise
When the darkness closes in Lord
Still I will say

--

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your way
My heart will always say,
Lord Blessed be your name

--

Blessed be your name
When the sun's shining down on me
When the world's all as it should be
Blessed be your name

--

Blessed be your name
On the road marked with suffering
Though there's pain in the offering
Blessed be your name

--

Every blessing You pour out I'll
turn back to praise
When the darkness closes in, Lord
Still I will say...

--

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your way
My heart will always say,
Lord Blessed be your name

You give and take away
You give and take away
My heart will always say
Lord Blessed be your name

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your way
My heart will always say,
Lord Blessed be your name

At the Cross
--

I know a place, a wonderful place 
Where accused and condemned 
Find mercy and grace
Where the wrongs we have done 
And the wrongs done to us 
Were nailed there with Him 
There on the cross 

--

At the cross (at the cross)
He died for our sin
At the cross (at the cross)
He gave us life again 

--

I know a place, a wonderful place 
Where accused and condemned 
Find mercy and grace
Where the wrongs we have done 
And the wrongs done to us 
Were nailed there with Him 
There on the cross 

--

At the cross (at the cross)
He died for our sin
At the cross (at the cross)
He gave us life again 
(2x)

--

I know a place, a wonderful place 
Where accused and condemned 
Find mercy and grace
Where the wrongs we have done 
And the wrongs done to us 
Were nailed there with Him 
There on the cross

Psalm 27
--

The Lord is the light of my Salvation,
The Lord is the strength of my life,
Whom shall I fear, of whom shall I be afraid,
Whom shall I fear, O Lord
Whom shall I fear, whom shall I fear,
Of whom shall I be afraid?

I Lift my eyes up
--

I lift my eyes up, unto the mountains
Where does my help come from?
My help comes from You, maker of heaven
creator of the earth.

--

Oh how I need you Lord
You are my only hope
You are my only prayer

So I will wait for You
to come and rescue me
to come and give me life

--

I lift my eyes up, unto the mountains
Where does my help come from?
My help comes from You, maker of heaven
creator of the earth.

--

Oh how I need you Lord
You are my only hope
You are my only prayer

So I will wait for You
to come and rescue me
to come and give me life

I lift my eyes up, unto the mountains
Where does my help come from?

My God My Father
--

My God, my Father while I stray
Far from my home in life's rough way
O teach me from my heart to say
Thy will be done

--

Though dark my path, and sad my lot
Let me be still, and murmur not
Or breathe the prayer divinely taught
Thy will be done!

--

But if my fainting heart be blessed
With the Holy Spirit for its guest
My God to Thee I leave the rest
Thy will be done!

--

If Thou should call me to resign
What most I prize, never was mine
I only yield Thee what is Thine
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!

--

Renew my will from day to day
Blend it with Thine and take away
All that now makes it hard to say
Thy will be done!
(2x)

--

Then when on earth I breathe no more
The prayer oft mixed with tears before
I'll sing upon that joyful shore
Thy will be done!

--

My God, my Father while I stray
Far from my home in life's rough way
O teach me from my heart to say
Thy will be done

--

Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
