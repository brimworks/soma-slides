Danny's New Song
--

--
Man of Sorrows
--

Man of sorrows what a Name
For the Son of God Who came
Ruined sinners to reclaim
Hallelujah what a Saviour

--

Bearing shame 
and scoffing rude
In my place 
condemned He stood
Sealed my pardon 
with His Blood
Hallelujah what a Saviour

--

Guilty vile and helpless we
Spotless Lamb of God was He
Full atonement can it be
Hallelujah what a Saviour

--

Lifted up was He to die
It is finished was His Cry
Now in Heaven exalted high
Hallelujah what a Saviour

--

Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name.

Philippians 2:5-9

--

When He comes 
our Glorious King
All His ransomed home to bring
Then anew this song we'll sing
Hallelujah what a Saviour

--
Jesus Paid it All
--

I hear the Savior say,
Thy Strength indeed is small                  
Child of weakness watch and pray
Find in Me thine all in all
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
Sin has left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy power and Thine alone          
Can change the lepers spots
And melt the heart of stone   
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
Sin has left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete          
Jesus died my soul to save,
My lips shall still repeat   
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
Sin has left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

O praise the one who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead

--
When I Survey the Wondrous Cross
--

When I survey the wondrous cross, 
On which the Prince of Glory died
My richest gain I count but loss, 
And pour contempt on all my pride.

--

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast, 
Save in the death of Christ my God;
All the vain things that charm me most, 
I sacrifice them to His blood.

--

See from His head, His hands, His feet, 
Sorrow and love flow mingled down:
Did ever such love and sorrow meet, 
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

--
How Deep the Father's Love for Us
--

How deep the Father's love for us
How vast beyond all measure
That He would give His only Son
To make a wretch His treasure

--

How great the pain of searing loss
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the chosen One
Bring many sons to glory

--

Behold the Man upon a cross
My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers 

--

It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished

--

I will not boast in anything
No gifts, no powers, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection

--

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom
