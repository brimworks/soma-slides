Angels we Have Heard on High
--

Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing oâ€™er the plains,
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains.

--

Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!

--

Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song?

--

Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!

--

Come to Bethlehem and see
Christ Whose birth the angels sing;
Come, adore on bended knee,
Christ the Lord, the newborn King.

--

Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!

--

See Him in a manger laid,
Whom the choirs of angels praise;
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,
While our hearts in love we raise.

O For a Thousand Tongues
--

O, for a thousand tongues to sing
My great redeemers praise
The glories of my God and King
The triumphs of His grace

--

My gracious Master and my God
Assist me to proclaim
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honors of Thy name

--

So praise the name of Jesus!
So praise the name of Jesus!

--

Jesus the name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease,
Tis music in the sinner ears,
Tis life and health and peace.

He breaks the power of cancelled sin
He sets the prisoners free
His blood can make the foulest clean
His blood availed for me

--

So praise the name of Jesus!
So praise the name of Jesus!

He speaks, and, listening to His voice,
New life the dead receive,
The mournful, broken hearts rejoice,
The humble poor believe.

Glory to God and praise and love
Be ever, ever given
By saints below and saints above
The church in earth and Heaven

So praise the name of Jesus!
So praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

Joy To The World

Joy to the world, the Lord is come!
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing

--

Joy to the earth, the Savior reigns!
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods
rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy

--

He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders, wonders, of His love

O Holy Night
--

O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Saviour's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks, a new and glorious morn

--

Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices
O night divine, O night when Christ was born
O night, O holy night, O night divine

--

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here came the wise men from Orient land
The King of Kings, lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friend

--

He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger
Behold, your King, before Him lowly bend
Behold, your King, before Him lowly bend

--

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love, and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name

--

Christ is the Lord, O praise His name forever
His power and glory
ever more proclaim
