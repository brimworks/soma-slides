Doxology

All creation of our God and king
Lift your voice to Him and let us sing
Burning sun with golden beam
Silver moon with softer gleam
Oh praise Him

Breath of heaven, rushing wind so strong
Clouds that move in time with heaven's song
Rising morn, in praise rejoice
Stars of evening find a voice
Oh praise Him, oh praise Him

Praise God from whom all blessings flow
Praise him all creatures here below
Praise him above ye heavenly host
Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost
Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost

All things living, your creator bless
Come to worship Him in humbleness
Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one
Oh praise Him, oh praise Him

God of Justice
--

God of Justice, Savior to all
Came to rescue the weak and the poor
Chose to serve and not be served

--

Jesus, You have called us
Freely we've received
Now freely we will give

--

We must go live to feed the hungry
Stand beside the broken
We must go
Stepping forward keep us from just singing
Move us into action
We must go

--

To act justly everyday
Loving mercy in every way
Walking humbly before You God

--

You have shown us, what You require
Freely we've received
Now freely we will give

--

We must go live to feed the hungry
Stand beside the broken
We must go
Stepping forward keep us from just singing
Move us into action
We must go

--

Fill us up and send us out
Fill us up and send us out
Fill us up and send us out Lord

--
How Deep the Father's Love for Us
--

How deep the Father's love for us
How vast beyond all measure
That He would give His only Son
To make a wretch His treasure

--

How great the pain of searing loss
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the chosen One
Bring many sons to glory

--

Behold the Man upon a cross
My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers 

--

It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished

--

I will not boast in anything
No gifts, no powers, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection

--

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom

--
Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing
--

Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

--

Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the name I'm fixed upon it
Name of God's redeeming love

--

Hither to Thy love has blest me
Thou hast brought me to this place
And I know Thy hand will bring me
Safely home by Thy good grace

--

Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wand'ring from the fold of God
He to rescue me from danger
Bought me with His precious blood

--

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee

--

Prone to wander Lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart O take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above

Our God
--

Water you turned into wine,
opened the eyes of the blind
there's no one like you, none like You!

--

Into the darkness you shine
out of the ashes we rise
there's no one like you, none like You!

--

Our God is greater, our God is stronger,
God you are higher than any other.
Our God is Healer, Awesome in Power,
Our God! Our God!

--

Water you turned into wine,

And if our God is for us,
then who could ever stop us.
And if our God is with us,
then what could stand against.

--

God you are higher than any other.
Our God is Healer, Awesome in Power,
Our God! Our God!
