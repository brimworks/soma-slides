My God Reigns
--

There's nowhere else that I'd rather be
Than dancing with you as you sing over me
There's nothing else that I'd rather do
Lord, than to worship you

--

So rejoice, be glad,
rejoice oh my soul
For the Lord, your God,
He reigns forever more
I rejoice, for my God reigns
So rejoice, be glad,
your Father and your Friend
Is the Lord, your God,
Whose rule will never end
I rejoice, for my God reigns

--

My God reigns
And I dance the dance of praise
My God reigns
With a shout I will proclaim
My God reigns
And I worship without shame
My God reigns
And I will rejoice, for my God reigns

How Firm a Foundation
--

How firm a foundation
ye saints of the Lord 
is laid for your faith
in his excellent word!
What more can he say
than to you he hath said, 
to you who for refuge
to Jesus have fled?

--

Fear not, I am with thee
Oh, be not dismayed
For I am thy God, and
will still give thee aid
I'll strengthen and help thee
and cause thee to stand 
upheld by my righteous
omnipotent hand

--

When through deep waters 
I call thee to go
the rivers of woe
shall not thee overflow
For I will be with thee 
thy troubles to bless 
and sanctify to thee
thy deepest distress

--

When through fiery trials
thy pathways shall lie 
My grace all-sufficient
shall be thy supply
The flame shall not harm
thee I only design 
Thy dross to consume
and thy gold to refine

--
Lord Have Mercy
--

Jesus I've forgotten
The words that You have spoken
Promises that burned within my heart
Have now grown dim
With a doubting heart I follow
The paths of earthly wisdom
Forgive me for my unbelief
Renew the fire again

--

Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on me

--

I have built an altar
Where I worship things of man
I have taken journeys
That have drawn me far from You
But now I am returning
To your mercies ever flowing
Pardon my transgressions
Help me love You again

--

Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on me

--

I have longed to know You
And all Your tender mercies
Like a river of forgiveness
Ever flowing without end
So I bow my heart before You
In the goodness of Your presence
Your grace forever shining
Like a beacon in the night

--

Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on me

O For a Thousand Tongues
--

O, for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer praise
The glories of my God and King
The triumphs of His grace

--

My gracious Master and my God
Assist me to proclaim
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honors of Thy name

--

Jesus! The name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease,
Tis music in the sinner ears,
Tis life and health and peace.

--

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

--

He breaks the power of cancelled sin
He sets the prisoners free
His blood can make the foulest clean
His blood availed for me

--

Here Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb,
Your loosened tongues employ;
Ye blind, behold your Savior come;
And leap, ye lame, for joy.

--

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

--

Glory to God and praise and love
Be ever, ever given
By saints below and saints above
The church in earth and Heaven

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

Be Thou My Vision
--

Be Thou my vision O Lord of my heart
Nought be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best thought by day or by night
Waking or sleeping Thy presence my light

--

Be Thou my Wisdom and Thou my true Word
I ever with Thee and Thou with me Lord
Thou my great Father I Thy true son
Thou in me dwelling and I with Thee one

--

Riches I heed not nor mans empty praise
Thou mine inheritance now and always
Thou and Thou only first in my heart
High King of heaven my treasure Thou art

--

High King of heaven, my victory won
May I reach heavens joys
O bright heavens sun!
Heart of my own heart whatever befall
Still be my vision O ruler of all
