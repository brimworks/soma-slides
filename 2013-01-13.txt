How Firm a Foundation
--

How firm a foundation
ye saints of the Lord
is laid for your faith
in his excellent word!
What more can he say
than to you he hath said,
to you who for refuge
to Jesus have fled?

--

Fear not, I am with thee
Oh, be not dismayed
For I am thy God, and
will still give thee aid
I'll strengthen and help thee
and cause thee to stand
upheld by my righteous
omnipotent hand

--

When through deep waters
I call thee to go
the rivers of woe
shall not thee overflow
For I will be with thee
thy troubles to bless
and sanctify to thee
thy deepest distress

--

When through fiery trials
thy pathways shall lie
My grace all-sufficient
shall be thy supply
The flame shall not harm
thee I only design
Thy dross to consume
and thy gold to refine

Our God
--

Water you turned into wine,
opened the eyes of the blind
there's no one like you, none like You!

--

Into the darkness you shine
out of the ashes we rise
there's no one like you, none like You!

--

Our God is greater, our God is stronger,
God you are higher than any other.
Our God is Healer, Awesome in Power,
Our God! Our God!

And if our God is for us,
then who could ever stop us.
And if our God is with us,
then what could stand against.

Nothing Without You
--

Take these hands, and lift them up
For I have not the strength to praise You near enough
See, I have nothing I have nothing without You

--

And take my voice and pour it out
Let it sing the songs of mercy I have found
For I have nothing I have nothing without You

--

And all my soul needs is all Your
Love to cover me
So all the world will see
That I have nothing, without you

--

Take my body and build it up
May it be broken as an offering of love
For I have nothing I have nothing without You

--

And all my soul needs is all Your
Love to cover me
So all the world will see
That I have nothing, without you

--

That I love You, with all my heart,
with all my soul, with all my mind
And all the strength I can find

--

Take my time here on this earth
And let it glorify all that You are worth
For I am nothing, I am nothing, without you

House of God Forever
--

God is my Sheppard
I won't be wanting, I won't be wanting
He makes me rest
In fields of green, with quite streams

--

Even though I walk
Through the valley, of death and dying
I will not fear
Cause You are with me, You are with me

--

Your Sheppard's staff
Comforts me
You are my feast
In the presence of enemies
Surely goodness
Will follow me, follow me
In the house of God forever

Victory in Jesus
--

I heard an old, old story,
How a savior came from glory
How He gave his life on Calvary
To save a wretch like me
I heard about His groaning,
His precious blood’s atoning
Then I repented of my sins
And won the victory

--

Oh victory in Jesus, my Savior forever
He sought me and bought me
With his redeeming blood
He loved me ere I knew him
And all my love is due him
He plunged me to victory
Beneath the cleansing flood

--

I heard about his healing,
Of His cleansing power revealing
How He made the lame to walk again
And caused the blind to see
And then I cried dear Jesus,
Come and heal my broken Spirit
And some how Jesus came
And bought to me the victory

--

Oh victory in Jesus, my Savior forever
He sought me and bought me
With his redeeming blood
He loved me ere I knew him
And all my love is due him
He plunged me to victory
Beneath the cleansing flood

--

I heard about a mansion
He has built for me in Glory
And I heard about the streets
Of Gold beyond the crystal sea
About the angels singing
And the old redemption story
And some sweet day I’ll sing up there
The song of victory

--

Oh victory in Jesus, my Savior forever
He sought me and bought me
With his redeeming blood
He loved me ere I knew him
And all my love is due him
He plunged me to victory
Beneath the cleansing flood
