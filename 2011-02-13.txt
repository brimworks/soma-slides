Holy Is The Lord

We stand and lift up our hands         

For the joy of the Lord is our strength
We bow down and worship Him now                      
How great how awesome is He
And together we sing

Holy is the Lord God Almighty   
The earth is filled with His glory  
Holy is the Lord God Almighty   
The earth is filled with His glory   
The earth is filled with His glory

Everything

God in my living, there in my breathing
God in my waking, God in my sleeping
God in my resting, there in my working
God in my thinking, God in my speaking

--

Be my everything, be my everything
Be my everything, be my everything

--

God in my hoping, there in my dreaming
God in my watching, God in my waiting
God in my laughing, there in my weeping
God in my hurting, God in my healing

--

Be my everything, be my everything
Be my everything, be my everything

--

Christ in me, Christ in me
Christ in me,
The hope of glory!
You are everything
Christ in me, Christ in me
Christ in me,
The hope of glory!
Be my everything

Be my everything, be my everything
Be my everything, be my everything
Be my everything, be my everything
Be my everything, be my everything

My God My Father
--

My God, my Father while I stray
Far from my home in life's rough way
O teach me from my heart to say
Thy will be done

--

Though dark my path, and sad my lot
Let me be still, and murmur not
Or breathe the prayer divinely taught
Thy will be done! 

--

But if my fainting heart be blessed 
With the Holy Spirit for its guest, 
My God to Thee I leave the rest
Thy will be done!

--

If Thou should call me to resign
 
What most I prize, never was mine
I only yield Thee what is Thine
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!

--

Renew my will from day to day 
Blend it with Thine and take away 
All that now makes it hard to say 
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!

--

Then when on earth I breathe no more
The prayer oft mixed with tears before,
I'll sing upon that joyful shore,
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!

Blessed Be Your Name
--

Blessed be your name,
In the land that is plentiful

Where Your streams of abundance flow
Blessed be Your name

--

Blessed be your name
When I'm found in the desert place
Though I walk through the wilderness
Blessed be Your name 

--

Every blessing You pour out
I'll turn back to praise
When the darkness closes in Lord
Still I will say

--

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your name
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your glorious name

--

Blessed be your name
When the sun's shining down on me
When the world's all as it should be
Blessed be your name

--

Blessed be your name
On the road marked with suffering
Though there's pain in the offering
Blessed be your name

--

Every blessing You pour out I'll
turn back to praise
When the darkness closes in, Lord
Still I will say...

--

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your name
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your glorious name

You give and take away
You give and take away
My heart will choose to say
Lord Blessed be your name

Blessed be Your name
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your glorious name

I Stand Amazed (How Marvelous)
--

I stand amazed in the presence,
Of Jesus the Nazarene 
And wonder how He could love me,
A sinner, condemned unclean

--

How marvelous, how wonderful 
And my song shall ever be 
How marvelous, how wonderful 
Is my Savior's love for me

--

He took my sins and my sorrows
He made them His very own 
And bore my burden to Calvary
and suffered and died alone

--

How marvelous, how wonderful 
And my song shall ever be 
How marvelous, how wonderful 
Is my Saviors love for me

--

When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see 
Twill be my joy through the ages
to sing of His love for me

--

How marvelous, how wonderful 
And my song shall ever be 
How marvelous, how wonderful 
Is my Saviors love for me
