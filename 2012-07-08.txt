Nothing But The Blood
--

What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

--

Oh precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

--

For my pardon this I see
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
For my cleansing this my plea
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

--

Oh precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

--

Nothing can for sin atone
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Naught of good that I have done
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

--

Oh precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

--

This is all my hope and peace
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
This is all my righteousness
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

--

Oh precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Come Thou Fount Of Every Blessing
--

Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

--

Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the name I'm fixed upon it
Name of God's redeeming love

--

Hither to Thy love has blest me
Thou hast brought me to this place
And I know Thy hand will bring me
Safely home by Thy good grace

--

Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wand'ring from the fold of God
He to rescue me from danger
Bought me with His precious blood

--

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee

--

Prone to wander Lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart O take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above

--
Before The Throne Of God Above
--

Before the throne of God above
I have a strong and perfect plea
The great High Priest whose name is Love 
Who ever lives and pleads for me

--

My name is graven on His hands 
My name is written on His heart
I know that while in heaven He stands 
No tongue can bid me thence depart
No tongue can bid me thence depart

--

When Satan tempts me to despair 
And tells me of the guilt within 
Upward I look to see Him there 
Who made an end to all my sin

--

Because the sinless Savior died 
My sinful soul is counted free 
For God the Just is satisfied 
to look on him and pardon me 
to look on him and pardon me 

--

Behold him there the risen Lamb
My perfect spotless Righteousness 
The great unchangeable I AM
The King of glory and of grace

--

One with Himself I cannot die
My soul is purchased by His blood
My life is hid with Christ on high 
with Christ my Savior and my God

Be Thou My Vision
--

Be Thou my vision O Lord of my heart
Nought be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best thought by day or by night
Waking or sleeping Thy presence my light

--

Be Thou my Wisdom and Thou my true Word
I ever with Thee and Thou with me Lord
Thou my great Father I Thy true son
Thou in me dwelling and I with Thee one

--

Riches I heed not nor mans empty praise
Thou mine inheritance now and always
Thou and Thou only first in my heart
High King of heaven my treasure Thou art

--

High King of heaven, my victory won
May I reach heavens joys
O bright heavens sun!
Heart of my own heart whatever befall
Still be my vision O ruler of all

--
My God My Father
--

My God, my Father while I stray
Far from my home in life's rough way
O teach me from my heart to say
Thy will be done

--

Though dark my path, and sad my lot
Let me be still, and murmur not
O breathe the prayer divinely taught
Thy will be done!

--

But if my fainting heart be blessed
With the Holy Spirit for its guest
My God to Thee I leave the rest
Thy will be done!

--

If Thou should call me to resign
What most I prize, never was mine
I only yield Thee what is Thine
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!

--

Renew my will from day to day
Blend it with Thine and take away
All that now makes it hard to say
Thy will be done!

--

Then when on earth I breathe no more
The prayer oft mixed with tears before
I'll sing upon that joyful shore
Thy will be done!

--

Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!

House Of God Forever 
--

God is my Shepherd
I won't be wanting,
I won't be wanting
He makes me rest
In fields of green by quiet streams

--

Even though I walk
Through the valley of death and dying
I will not fear
For You are with me,
You're always with me

--

Your Shepherd's staff comforts me
You are my feast in the presence of enemies
Surely goodness will follow me, follow me
In the House of God, forever

--
