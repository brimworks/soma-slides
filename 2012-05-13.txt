Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing
--

Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

--

Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the mount I'm fixed upon it
Mount of Thy redeeming love

--

Here I raise my Ebenezer
Hither by Thy help I'm come
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home

--

Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wandering from the fold of God
He, to rescue me from danger
Interposed His precious blood

--

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee

--

Prone to wander Lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart O take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above

--
How Firm a Foundation
--

How firm a foundation
ye saints of the Lord 
is laid for your faith
in his excellent word!
What more can he say
than to you he hath said, 
to you who for refuge
to Jesus have fled?

--

Fear not, I am with thee
Oh, be not dismayed
For I am thy God, and
will still give thee aid
I'll strengthen and help thee
and cause thee to stand 
upheld by my righteous
omnipotent hand

--

When through deep waters 
I call thee to go
the rivers of woe
shall not thee overflow
For I will be with thee 
thy troubles to bless 
and sanctify to thee
thy deepest distress

--

When through fiery trials
thy pathways shall lie 
My grace all-sufficient
shall be thy supply
The flame shall not harm
thee I only design 
Thy dross to consume
and thy gold to refine

Message

Message

--
How Deep the Father's Love for Us
--

How deep the Father's love for us
How vast beyond all measure
That He would give His only Son
To make a wretch His treasure

--

How great the pain of searing loss
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the chosen One
Bring many sons to glory

--

Behold the Man upon a cross
My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers 

--

It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished

--

I will not boast in anything
No gifts, no powers, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection

--

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom

--
The Solid Rock
--

My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus’ blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus’ name

--


On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When darkness veils His lovely face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

His oath, His covenant, His blood
Support me in the whelming flood
When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my hope and stay

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh, may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the throne

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--
The Love of Christ is Rich and Free
--

The love of Christ is rich and free
Fixed on His own eternally
Nor earth, nor hell, can it remove
Long as He lives, His own He’ll love

--

His loving heart engaged to be 
Their everlasting Surety
’Twas love that took their cause in hand
And love maintains it to the end 

--

Love cannot from its post withdraw
Nor death, nor hell, nor sin, nor law
Can turn the Surety’s heart away 
He’ll love His own to endless day

--

Love has redeemed His sheep with blood
And love will bring them safe to God
Love calls them all from death to life
And love will finish all their strife

--

He loves through every changing scene
Nor aught from Him can Zion wean 
Not all the wanderings of her heart 
Can make His love for her depart

--

Love cannot from its post withdraw
Nor death, nor hell, nor sin, nor law 
Can turn the Surety’s heart away
He’ll love His own to endless day

--

At death, beyond the grave, He’ll love
In endless bliss, His own shall prove 
The blazing glory of that love 
Which never could from them remove
