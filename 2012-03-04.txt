Your Love Never Fails
--

Nothing can separate
Even if I ran away
Your love never fails

--

I know I still make mistakes
But You have new mercies for me everyday
Your love never fails

--

You stay the same through the ages
Your love never changes
There may be pain in the night
But joy comes in the morning

--

And when the oceans rage
I don't have to be afraid
Because I know that You love me
Your love never fails

--

The wind is strong and the water's deep
But I'm not alone here in these open seas
Cause Your love never fails

--

The chasm is far too wide
I never thought I'd reach the other side
But Your love never fails

--

You stay the same through the ages
Your love never changes
There may be pain in the night
But joy comes in the morning

--

And when the oceans rage
I don't have to be afraid
Because I know that You love me
Your love never fails

--

You make all things
work together for my good
(6x)

--

You stay the same through the ages
Your love never changes
There may be pain in the night
But joy comes in the morning

--

And when the oceans rage
I don't have to be afraid
Because I know that You love me
Your love never fails

--

Sermon

Sermon

--
How Deep the Father's Love for Us
--

How deep the Father's love for us
How vast beyond all measure
That He should give His only Son
And make a wretch His treasure

--

How great the pain of searing loss
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the chosen One
Bring many sons to glory

--

Behold the Man upon the cross
My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers 

--

It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished

--

I will not boast in anything
No gifts, no power, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection

--

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom

--
Jesus Paid it All
--

I hear the Savior say,
Thy Strength indeed is small                  
Child of weakness watch and pray
Find in Me thine all in all
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
Sin has left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy power and Thine alone          
Can change the lepers spots
And melt the heart of stone   
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
Sin has left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete          
Jesus died my soul to save,
My lips shall still repeat   
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
Sin has left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

O praise the one who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead

--
In Christ Alone
--

In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm

--

What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
My Comforter, my All in All
Here in the love of Christ I stand

--

In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save

--

Till on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

--

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again

--

And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

--

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny

--

No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand

--
Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing
--

Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

--

Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the name I'm fixed upon it
Name of God's redeeming love

--

Hither to Thy love has blest me
Thou hast brought me to this place
And I know Thy hand will bring me
Safely home by Thy good grace

--

Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wand'ring from the fold of God
He to rescue me from danger
Bought me with His precious blood

--

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee

--

Prone to wander Lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart O take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above
