The Love of Christ is Rich and Free
--

The love of Christ is rich and free; 
Fixed on His own eternally; 
Nor earth, nor hell, can it remove; 
Long as He lives, His own He’ll love.


--

His loving heart engaged to be 
Their everlasting Surety; 
’Twas love that took their cause in hand, 
And love maintains it to the end.  

--

Love cannot from its post withdraw; 
Nor death, nor hell, nor sin, nor law, 
Can turn the Surety’s heart away; 
He’ll love His own to endless day. 

--

Love has redeemed His sheep with blood; 
And love will bring them safe to God; 
Love calls them all from death to life; 
And love will finish all their strife. 

--

He loves through every changing scene, 
Nor aught from Him can Zion wean; 
Not all the wanderings of her heart 
Can make His love for her depart.

--

Love cannot from its post withdraw; 
Nor death, nor hell, nor sin, nor law, 
Can turn the Surety’s heart away; 
He’ll love His own to endless day.

--

At death, beyond the grave, He’ll love; 
In endless bliss, His own shall prove 
The blazing glory of that love 
Which never could from them remove.

How Great Thou Art
--

O Lord my God,
When I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the worlds
Thy Hands have made;
I see the stars,
I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout
the universe displayed.

--

Then sings my soul,
My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul,
My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.

--

When through the woods,
and forest glades I wander,
And hear the birds
sing sweetly in the trees.
When I look down,
from lofty mountain grandeur
And see the brook,
and feel the gentle breeze.

--

Then sings my soul,
My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul,
My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.

--

And when I think,
that God, His Son not sparing;
Sent Him to die,
I scarce can take it in;
That on the Cross,
my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died
to take away my sin.

--

Then sings my soul,
My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul,
My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.

--

When Christ shall come,
with shout of acclamation,
And take me home,
what joy shall fill my heart.
Then I shall bow,
in humble adoration,
And then proclaim:
"My God, how great Thou art!"

--

Then sings my soul,
My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul,
My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.

Sermon

Psalm 27
--

The Lord is the light of my Salvation,
The Lord is the strength of my life,
Whom shall I fear, of whom shall I be afraid,
Whom shall I fear, O Lord
Whom shall I fear, whom shall I fear,
Of whom shall I be afraid?

--
What The Lord Has Done In Me
--

Let the weak say, "I am strong."
Let the poor say, "I am rich."
Let the blind say, "I can see;
It's what the Lord has done in me."

Hosanna, hosanna to the Lamb that was slain.
Hosanna, hosanna, Jesus died and rose again.

--

In-to the river I will wade.
There my sins are washed a-way.
From the heavens mercy streams
Of the Savior's love for me.

Hosanna, hosanna to the Lamb that was slain.
Hosanna, hosanna, Jesus died and rose again.

--

I will rise from waters deep
Into the saving arms of God.
I will sing salvation songs;
Jesus Christ has set me free.

Hosanna, hosanna to the Lamb that was slain.
Hosanna, hosanna, Jesus died and rose again.

--

Let the weak say, "I am strong."
Let the poor say, "I am rich."
Let the blind say, "I can see;
It's what the Lord has done in me."

Hosanna, hosanna to the Lamb that was slain.
Hosanna, hosanna, Jesus died and rose again.

How Firm a Foundation
--

How firm a foundation
ye saints of the Lord 
is laid for your faith
in his excellent word!
What more can he say
than to you he hath said, 
to you who for refuge
to Jesus have fled?

--

Fear not, I am with thee
Oh, be not dismayed
For I am thy God, and
will still give thee aid
I'll strengthen and help thee
and cause thee to stand 
upheld by my righteous
omnipotent hand

--

When through deep waters 
I call thee to go
the rivers of woe
shall not thee overflow
For I will be with thee 
thy troubles to bless 
and sanctify to thee
thy deepest distress

--

When through fiery trials
thy pathways shall lie 
My grace all-sufficient
shall be thy supply
The flame shall not harm
thee I only design 
Thy dross to consume
and thy gold to refine

--
I'll Fly Away
--

Some glad morning when this life is over,
I'll fly away
To a land on God's celestial shore,
I'll fly away

--

I'll fly away oh glory, I'll fly away
When I die hallelujah by and by,
I'll fly away

--

When the shadows of this life have gone,
I'll fly away
Like a bird from prison walls has flown,
I'll fly away

--

I'll fly away oh glory, I'll fly away
When I die hallelujah by and by,
I'll fly away

--

Oh how glad and happy when we meet,
I'll fly away
No more cold iron shackles on my feet,
I'll fly away

--

I'll fly away oh glory, I'll fly away
When I die hallelujah by and by,
I'll fly away

--

Just a few more weary days and then,
I'll fly away
To a land where joy shall never end,
I'll fly away

--

I'll fly away oh glory, I'll fly away
When I die hallelujah by and by,
I'll fly away
