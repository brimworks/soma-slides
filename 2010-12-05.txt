All Hail The Power Of Jesus Name
--

All hail the power of Jesus' name
Let angels prostrate fall
Bring forth the royal diadem
And crown Him Lord of all
Bring forth the royal diadem
And crown Him Lord of all

--

Ye chosen seed of Israel's race
Ye ransomed from the fall
Hail Him who saves you by His grace
And crown Him Lord of all
Hail Him who saves you by His grace
And crown Him Lord of all

--

Let every kindred every tribe
On this terrestrial ball
To Him all majesty ascribe
And crown Him Lord of all
To Him all majesty ascribe
And crown Him Lord of all

--

O that with yonder sacred throng
We at His feet may fall
We'll join the everlasting song
And crown Him Lord of all
We'll join the everlasting song
And crown Him Lord of all

Blessed Be Your Name / It is Well Medley
--

You give and take away
You give and take away
My heart will choose to say
Lord blessed be Your name

--

Blessed be Your name
In the land that is plentiful
Where Your streams of 
abundance flow
Blessed be Your name

--

Blessed be Your name
When I'm found in the desert place
Though I walk through 
the wilderness
Blessed be Your name

--

When peace, like a river, 
attendeth my way,
When sorrows like sea billows roll;
Whatever my lot, 
Thou has taught me to say,
It is well, it is well, with my soul.

--

Blessed be Your name
When the sun's shining down on me
When the world's all as it should be
Blessed be Your name

--

Blessed be Your name
On the road marked with suffering
Though there's pain in the offering
Blessed be Your name

--

Though Satan should buffet, 
though trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control,
That Christ has regarded
 my helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood 
for my soul.

--

My sin, oh, the bliss 
of this glorious thought!
My sin, not in part but the whole,
Is nailed to the cross, 
and I bear it no more,
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, 
O my soul!

--

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your name
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your glorious name (x2)

--

And Lord, haste the day 
when my faith shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
The trump shall resound, 
and the Lord shall descend,
Even so, it is well with my soul.

--

It is well, with my soul,
It is well, with my soul,
It is well, it is well, with my soul. (x2)

Sermon
--

--
My God My Father Though I Stray
--

My God my Father while I stray
Far from my home on life's rough way
O teach me from my heart to say
Thy will be done

--

Though dark my path and sad my lot
Let me be still and murmur not
Or breathe the prayer divinely taught
Thy will be done

--

But if my fainting heart be blessed
With the Holy Spirit for its guest,
My God to Thee I leave the rest
Thy will be done

--

If Thou should call me to resign
What most I prize, never was mine;
I only yield Thee what is Thine;
Thy will be done! (x2)

--

Renew my will from day to day
Blend it with Thine and take away
All that now makes it hard to say
Thy will be done (x2)

--

Then when on earth I breathe no more
The prayer oft mixed with tears before,
I'll sing upon that joyful shore,
Thy will be done

--

Renew my will from day to day
Blend it with Thine and take away
All that now makes it hard to say
Thy will be done (x2)

Holy Infant so tender and mild

Radiant beams from the holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
