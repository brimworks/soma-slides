Be Thou My Vision
--

Be Thou my vision O Lord of my heart
Nought be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best thought by day or by night
Waking or sleeping Thy presence my light

--

Be Thou my Wisdom and Thou my true Word
I ever with Thee and Thou with me Lord
Thou my great Father I Thy true son
Thou in me dwelling and I with Thee one

--

Riches I heed not nor mans empty praise
Thou mine inheritance now and always
Thou and Thou only first in my heart
High King of heaven my treasure Thou art

--

High King of heaven, my victory won
May I reach heavens joys
O bright heavens sun!
Heart of my own heart whatever befall
Still be my vision O ruler of all

The Solid Rock
--

My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus' name

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When darkness veils His lovely face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

His oath, His covenant, His blood
Support me in the whelming flood
When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my hope and stay

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh, may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the throne

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--
Before The Throne Of God Above
--

Before the throne of God above
I have a strong and perfect plea
The great High Priest whose name is Love 
Who ever lives and pleads for me

--

My name is graven on His hands 
My name is written on His heart
I know that while in heaven He stands 
No tongue can bid me thence depart
No tongue can bid me thence depart

--

When Satan tempts me to despair 
And tells me of the guilt within 
Upward I look to see Him there 
Who made an end to all my sin

--

Because the sinless Savior died 
My sinful soul is counted free 
For God the Just is satisfied 
to look on him and pardon me 
to look on him and pardon me 

--

Behold him there the risen Lamb
My perfect spotless Righteousness 
The great unchangeable I AM
The King of glory and of grace

--

One with Himself I cannot die
My soul is purchased by His blood
My life is hid with Christ on high 
with Christ my Savior and my God

Message

Message

--
Your Love Is Strong
--

Heavenly Father
You always amaze me
Let your kingdom come
In my world and in my life

--

Give me the food I need
To live through today
And forgive me as I forgive
The people that wronged me

--

Lead me far from temptation
Deliver me from the evil one

--

I look out the window
The birds are composing
Not a note is out of tune
Or out of place

--

I look at the meadow
And stare at the flowers
Better dressed than any girl
On her wedding day

--

So why do I worry?
Why do I freak out?
God knows what I need
You know what I need

--

Your love is
Your love is
Your love is strong

--

The kingdom of the heavens
Is now advancing
Invade my heart
Invade this broken town

--

The kingdom of the heavens
Is buried treasure
Will you sell yourself
To buy the one you've found?

--

Two things you told me
That you are strong
And you love me
Yes, you love me

--

Your love is
Your love is
Your love is strong

--

Oh God in heaven
Hallowed be
Thy name above all names
Your kingdom come
Your will be done
On earth as it is in heaven

--

Give us today our daily bread
Forgive us weary sinners
Lead us far from our vices
And deliver us from these prisons

--
Come Thou Fount Of Every Blessing
--

Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

--

Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the name I'm fixed upon it
Name of God's redeeming love

--

Hither to Thy love has blest me
Thou hast brought me to this place
And I know Thy hand will bring me
Safely home by Thy good grace

--

Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wand'ring from the fold of God
He to rescue me from danger
Bought me with His precious blood

--

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee

--

Prone to wander Lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart O take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above

--
Doxology
--

Praise God, from Whom all blessings flow
Praise Him, all creatures here below
Praise Him above, ye heavenly host
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost

Amen (4x)
