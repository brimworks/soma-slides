Amazing Grace
--

Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

--

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed!

--

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
T'was grace that brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

--

When we’ve been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Than when we’d first begun. 

--

Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

How He loves
--

He is jealous for me
Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree
Bending beneath the weight of his wind and mercy

--

When all of a sudden
I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory
And I realise just how beautiful You are
And how great Your affections are for me

--

And oh, how He loves us
Oh, oh how He loves us
How He loves us all

--

He is jealous for me
Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree
Bending beneath the weight of his wind and mercy

--

When all of a sudden
I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory
And I realise just how beautiful You are
And how great Your affections are for me

--

Yeah, He loves us
Whoa! how He loves us
Whoa! how He loves us
Whoa! how He loves

--

And we are His portion and He is our prize
Drawn to the redemption by the grace in His eyes
If grace is an ocean, we're all sinking

--

And Heaven meets earth like a unforseen kiss
And my heart turns violently inside of my chest
I don't have time to maintain these regrets
When I think about, the way...

--

Oh how he loves us
Oh, Oh how he loves us
How he loves us
Oh, how he loves

--

Yeah, He loves us
Whoa! how He loves us
Whoa! how He loves us
Whoa! how He loves

Before the Throne of God Above
--

Before the throne of God above
I have a strong and perfect plea
The great High Priest whose name is Love 
Who ever lives and pleads for me

--

My name is graven on His hands 
My name is written on His heart
I know that while in heaven He stands 
No tongue can bid me thence depart
No tongue can bid me thence depart

--

When Satan tempts me to despair 
And tells me of the guilt within 
Upward I look to see Him there 
Who made an end to all my sin

--

Because the sinless Savior died 
My sinful soul is counted free 
For God the Just is satisfied 
to look on him and pardon me 
to look on him and pardon me 

--

Behold him there the risen Lamb
My perfect spotless Righteousness 
The great unchangeable I AM
The King of glory and of grace

--

One with Himself I cannot die
My soul is purchased by His blood
My life is hid with Christ on high 
with Christ my Savior and my God

--
Christ has risen
--

Let no one caught in sin remain
Inside the lie of inward shame
We fix our eyes upon the cross
And run to Him who showed great love
And bled for us
Freely You've bled for us

--

Christ is risen from the dead
Trampling over death by death
Come awake, come awake
Come and rise up from the grave
Christ is risen from the dead
We are one with Him again
Come awake, come awake
Come and rise up from the grave

--

Beneath the weight of all our sin
You bowed to none but heaven's will
No scheme of hell, no scoffer's crown
No burden great can hold You down
In strength You reign
Forever let Your church proclaim

--

Christ is risen from the dead
Trampling over death by death
Come awake, come awake
Come and rise up from the grave
Christ is risen from the dead
We are one with Him again
Come awake, come awake
Come and rise up from the grave

--

O death, where is your sting?
O hell, where is your victory?
O church, come stand in the light
The glory of God has defeated the night

--

O death, where is your sting?
O hell, where is your victory?
O church, come stand in the light
Our God is not dead
He's alive! He's alive!

--

Christ is risen from the dead
Trampling over death by death
Come awake, come awake
Come and rise up from the grave
Christ is risen from the dead
We are one with Him again
Come awake, come awake
Come and rise up from the grave
