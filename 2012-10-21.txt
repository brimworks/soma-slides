My God Reigns
--

There's nowhere else that I'd rather be
Than dancing with you as you sing over me
There's nothing else that I'd rather do
Lord, than to worship you

--

So rejoice, be glad,
rejoice oh my soul
For the Lord, your God,
He reigns forever more
I rejoice, for my God reigns
So rejoice, be glad,
your Father and your Friend
Is the Lord, your God,
Whose rule will never end
I rejoice, for my God reigns

--

My God reigns
And I dance the dance of praise
My God reigns
With a shout I will proclaim
My God reigns
And I worship without shame
My God reigns
And I will rejoice, for my God reigns

The Solid Rock
--

My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus’ blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus’ name

--


On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When darkness veils His lovely face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

His oath, His covenant, His blood
Support me in the whelming flood
When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my hope and stay

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh, may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the throne

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand
