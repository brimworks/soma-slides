O For a Thousand Tongues
--

O, for a thousand tongues to sing
My great redeemers praise
The glories of my God and King
The triumphs of His grace

--

My gracious Master and my God
Assist me to proclaim
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honors of Thy name

--

So praise the name of Jesus!
So praise the name of Jesus!

--

Jesus the name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease,
Tis music in the sinner ears,
Tis life and health and peace.

--

He breaks the power of cancelled sin
He sets the prisoners free
His blood can make the foulest clean
His blood availed for me

--

So praise the name of Jesus!
So praise the name of Jesus!

--

He speaks, and, listening to His voice,
New life the dead receive,
The mournful, broken hearts rejoice,
The humble poor believe.

--

Glory to God and praise and love
Be ever, ever given
By saints below and saints above
The church in earth and Heaven

--

So praise the name of Jesus!
So praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

In Christ Alone
--

In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm

--

What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
My Comforter, my All in All
Here in the love of Christ I stand

--

In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save

--

Till on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

--

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again

--

And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

--

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny

--

No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand

Message

Be Thou My Vision
--

Be Thou my vision O Lord of my heart
Nought be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best thought by day or by night
Waking or sleeping Thy presence my light

--

Be Thou my Wisdom and Thou my true Word
I ever with Thee and Thou with me Lord
Thou my great Father I Thy true son
Thou in me dwelling and I with Thee one

--

Riches I heed not nor mans empty praise
Thou mine inheritance now and always
Thou and Thou only first in my heart
High King of heaven my treasure Thou art

--

High King of heaven, my victory won
May I reach heavens joys
O bright heavens sun!
Heart of my own heart whatever befall
Still be my vision O ruler of all

--
Before the Throne of God Above
--

Before the throne of God above
I have a strong and perfect plea
The great High Priest whose name is Love 
Who ever lives and pleads for me

--

My name is graven on His hands 
My name is written on His heart
I know that while in heaven He stands 
No tongue can bid me thence depart
No tongue can bid me thence depart

--

When Satan tempts me to despair 
And tells me of the guilt within 
Upward I look to see Him there 
Who made an end to all my sin

--

Because the sinless Savior died 
My sinful soul is counted free 
For God the Just is satisfied 
to look on him and pardon me 
to look on him and pardon me 

--

Behold him there the risen Lamb
My perfect spotless Righteousness 
The great unchangeable I AM
The King of glory and of grace

--

One with Himself I cannot die
My soul is purchased by His blood
My life is hid with Christ on high 
with Christ my Savior and my God

--
I Stand Amazed
--

I stand amazed in the presence,
Of Jesus the Nazarene 
And wonder how He could love me,
A sinner condemned unclean

--

How marvelous, how wonderful 
And my song shall ever be 
How marvelous, how wonderful 
Is my Savior's love for me

--

He took my sins and my sorrows
He made them His very own 
And bore my burden to Calvary
and suffered and died alone

--

How marvelous, how wonderful 
And my song shall ever be 
How marvelous, how wonderful 
Is my Savior's love for me

--

When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see 
Twill be my joy through the ages
to sing of His love for me

--

How marvelous, how wonderful 
And my song shall ever be 
How marvelous, how wonderful 
Is my Saviors love for me
