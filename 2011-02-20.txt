How Great is Our God

The splendor of a King
clothed in Majesty
Let all the earth rejoice

He wraps Himself in light
and darkness tries to hide
And trembles at His voice
Trembles at His voice

How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, all will see
How great, how great is our God

Age to age He stands
and time is in His hands
Beginning and the end

The Godhead, three in one
Father, Spirit, Son
The Lion and the Lamb
The Lion and the Lamb

Name above all names
Worthy of all Praise

Refine Me
--

I come into this place
Burning to receive your peace
I come with my own chains
From wars I've fought for my own selfish gain

--

You're my God and my Father
I've accepted your Son
But my soul feels so empty now
What have I become

--

Lord come with Your fire
Burn my desires refine me
Lord my will has deceived me
Please come and free me refine me

--

My heart can't see
When I only look at me
My soul can't hear
When I only think of my own fears

But they are gone in a moment
You're forever the same
Why did I look away from You
How can I speak Your name

--

Lord come with Your fire
Burn my desires refine me
Lord my will has deceived me
Please come and free me
Come rescue this child
For I long to be reconciled to You

--

It's all I can do
To give my heart and soul to You and pray
And pray oh I will pray

--

Lord come with Your fire
Burn my desires refine me
Lord my will has deceived me
Please come and free me
Come rescue this child
For I long to be reconciled to You

Refine me, refine me
Refine me, refine me

Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing
--

Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

--

Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the name I'm fixed upon it
Name of God's redeeming love

--

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee

--

Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart, O take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above

--

Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

--
My God My Father
--

My God, my Father while I stray
Far from my home in life's rough way
O teach me from my heart to say
Thy will be done

--

Though dark my path, and sad my lot
Let me be still, and murmur not
O breathe the prayer divinely taught
Thy will be done!

--

But if my fainting heart be blessed
With the Holy Spirit for its guest
My God to Thee I leave the rest
Thy will be done!

--

If Thou should call me to resign
What most I prize, never was mine
I only yield Thee what is Thine
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!

--

Renew my will from day to day
Blend it with Thine and take away
All that now makes it hard to say
Thy will be done!

--

Then when on earth I breathe no more
The prayer oft mixed with tears before
I'll sing upon that joyful shore
Thy will be done!

--

Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!

Rain
--

When I wake, You're there
When I run, You run for me
When I call, You listen

--

Just to believe that You want me
Makes me think
I'm bound to know You

--

Rain down on me
Give me the eyes to see
Rain down on me
And I will believe

--

When I wake, You're there
When I run, You run for me
When I call, You listen

--

Just to believe that You want me
Makes me think
I'm bound to know You

--

Rain down on me
Give me the eyes to see
Rain down on me
And I will believe

--

Make my life a prayer to You
Lord to do what You want me to
Rain Your Spirit down on me

--

Rain down on me
Give me the eyes to see
Rain down on me
And I will believe

--

When I wake, You're there
When I run, You run for me
