The Solid Rock
--

My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus' name

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When darkness veils His lovely face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

His oath, His covenant, His blood
Support me in the whelming flood
When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my hope and stay

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh, may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the throne

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

Sermon

God of Justice
--

God of Justice, Savior to all
Came to rescue the weak and the poor
Chose to serve and not be served

--

Jesus, You have called us
Freely we've received
Now freely we will give

--

We must go live to feed the hungry
Stand beside the broken
We must go
Stepping forward keep us from just singing
Move us into action
We must go

--

To act justly everyday
Loving mercy in every way
Walking humbly before You God

--

You have shown us, what You require
Freely we've received
Now freely we will give

--

We must go live to feed the hungry
Stand beside the broken
We must go
Stepping forward keep us from just singing
Move us into action
We must go

--

Fill us up and send us out
Fill us up and send us out
Fill us up and send us out Lord

--
My God My Father
--

My God, my Father while I stray
Far from my home in life's rough way
O teach me from my heart to say
Thy will be done

--

Though dark my path, and sad my lot
Let me be still, and murmur not
O breathe the prayer divinely taught
Thy will be done!

--

But if my fainting heart be blessed
With the Holy Spirit for its guest
My God to Thee I leave the rest
Thy will be done!

--

If Thou should call me to resign
What most I prize, never was mine
I only yield Thee what is Thine
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!

--

Renew my will from day to day
Blend it with Thine and take away
All that now makes it hard to say
Thy will be done!

--

Then when on earth I breathe no more
The prayer oft mixed with tears before
I'll sing upon that joyful shore
Thy will be done!

--

Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!

Our God
--

Water you turned into wine,
opened the eyes of the blind
there's no one like you, none like You!

--

Into the darkness you shine
out of the ashes we rise
there's no one like you, none like You!

--

Our God is greater, our God is stronger,
God you are higher than any other.
Our God is Healer, Awesome in Power,
Our God! Our God!

--

Water you turned into wine,
opened the eyes of the blind
there's no one like you, none like You!

--

Into the darkness you shine
out of the ashes we rise
there's no one like you, none like You!

--

Our God is greater, our God is stronger,
God you are higher than any other.
Our God is Healer, Awesome in Power,
Our God! Our God!

--

And if our God is for us,
then who could ever stop us.
And if our God is with us,
then what could stand against.

--

Our God is greater, our God is stronger,
God you are higher than any other.
Our God is Healer, Awesome in Power,
Our God! Our God!
