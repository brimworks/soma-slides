Be Thou My Vision
--

Be Thou my vision O Lord of my heart
Nought be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best thought by day or by night
Waking or sleeping Thy presence my light

--

Be Thou my Wisdom and Thou my true Word
I ever with Thee and Thou with me Lord
Thou my great Father I Thy true son
Thou in me dwelling and I with Thee one

--

Riches I heed not nor mans empty praise
Thou mine inheritance now and always
Thou and Thou only first in my heart
High King of heaven my treasure Thou art

--

High King of heaven, my victory won
May I reach heavens joys
O bright heavens sun!
Heart of my own heart whatever befall
Still be my vision O ruler of all

How Firm a Foundation
--

How firm a foundation
ye saints of the Lord 
is laid for your faith
in his excellent word!
What more can he say
than to you he hath said, 
to you who for refuge
to Jesus have fled?

--

Fear not, I am with thee
Oh, be not dismayed
For I am thy God, and
will still give thee aid
I'll strengthen and help thee
and cause thee to stand 
upheld by my righteous
omnipotent hand

--

When through deep waters 
I call thee to go
the rivers of woe
shall not thee overflow
For I will be with thee 
thy troubles to bless 
and sanctify to thee
thy deepest distress

--

When through fiery trials
thy pathways shall lie 
My grace all-sufficient
shall be thy supply
The flame shall not harm
thee I only design 
Thy dross to consume
and thy gold to refine

Message

Before the Throne of God Above
--

Before the throne of God above
I have a strong and perfect plea
The great High Priest whose name is Love 
Who ever lives and pleads for me

--

My name is graven on His hands 
My name is written on His heart
I know that while in heaven He stands 
No tongue can bid me thence depart
No tongue can bid me thence depart

--

When Satan tempts me to despair 
And tells me of the guilt within 
Upward I look to see Him there 
Who made an end to all my sin

--

Because the sinless Savior died 
My sinful soul is counted free 
For God the Just is satisfied 
to look on him and pardon me 
to look on him and pardon me 

--

Behold him there the risen Lamb
My perfect spotless Righteousness 
The great unchangeable I AM
The King of glory and of grace

--

One with Himself I cannot die
My soul is purchased by His blood
My life is hid with Christ on high 
with Christ my Savior and my God

--
The Love of Christ is Rich and Free
--

The love of Christ is rich and free
Fixed on His own eternally
Nor earth, nor hell, can it remove
Long as He lives, His own He’ll love

--

His loving heart engaged to be 
Their everlasting Surety
’Twas love that took their cause in hand
And love maintains it to the end 

--

Love cannot from its post withdraw
Nor death, nor hell, nor sin, nor law
Can turn the Surety’s heart away 
He’ll love His own to endless day

--

Love has redeemed His sheep with blood
And love will bring them safe to God
Love calls them all from death to life
And love will finish all their strife

--

He loves through every changing scene
Nor aught from Him can Zion wean 
Not all the wanderings of her heart 
Can make His love for her depart

--

Love cannot from its post withdraw
Nor death, nor hell, nor sin, nor law 
Can turn the Surety’s heart away
He’ll love His own to endless day

--

At death, beyond the grave, He’ll love
In endless bliss, His own shall prove 
The blazing glory of that love 
Which never could from them remove

--
Victory in Jesus
--

I heard an old, old story,
How a savior came from glory
How He gave his life on Calvary
To save a wretch like me
I heard about His groaning,
His precious blood’s atoning
Then I repented of my sins
And won the victory

--

Oh victory in Jesus, my Savior forever
He sought me and bought me
With his redeeming blood
He loved me ere I knew him
And all my love is due him
He plunged me to victory
Beneath the cleansing flood

--

I heard about his healing,
Of His cleansing power revealing
How He made the lame to walk again
And caused the blind to see
And then I cried dear Jesus,
Come and heal my broken Spirit
And some how Jesus came
And bought to me the victory

--

Oh victory in Jesus, my Savior forever
He sought me and bought me
With his redeeming blood
He loved me ere I knew him
And all my love is due him
He plunged me to victory
Beneath the cleansing flood

--

I heard about a mansion
He has built for me in Glory
And I heard about the streets
Of Gold beyond the crystal sea
About the angels singing
And the old redemption story
And some sweet day I’ll sing up there
The song of victory

--

Oh victory in Jesus, my Savior forever
He sought me and bought me
With his redeeming blood
He loved me ere I knew him
And all my love is due him
He plunged me to victory
Beneath the cleansing flood
