Sweetly singing oâ€™er the plains,

I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day
--

I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth, good will to men

--

I thought how, as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along the unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men

--

And in despair I bowed my head
"There is no peace on earth," I said
"For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men"

--

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
"God is not dead, nor doth he sleep
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
With peace on earth, good will to men"

--

Till, ringing singing, on its way
The world revolved from night to day
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime
Of peace on earth, good will to men!

--
Angels From the Realm of Glory
--

Angels from the realms of glory
Wing your flight over all the earth
Ye who sang creation's story
Now proclaim Messiah's birth

--

Come and worship
Come and worship
Worship Christ
The newborn King!

--

Shepherds, in the fields abiding
Watching over your flocks by night
God with man is now residing
Yonder shines the infant Light

--

Come and worship
Come and worship
Worship Christ
The newborn King!

--

Sages, leave your contemplations,
Brighter visions beam afar;
Seek the great Desire of Nations;
Ye have seen His natal star:

--

Come and worship
Come and worship
Worship Christ
The newborn King!

--

Saints, before the alter bending, 
Watching long in hope and fear,
Suddenly the Lord, Descending, 
In His temple shall appear:

--

Come and worship
Come and worship
Worship Christ
The newborn King!

--
Joy To The World
--

Joy to the world, the Lord is come!
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing

--

Joy to the earth, the Savior reigns!
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods
rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy

--

No more let sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found,
Far as the curse is found,
Far as, far as, the curse is found

--

He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders, wonders, of His love
