All Hail The Power Of Jesus Name
--

All hail the power of Jesus' name
Let angels prostrate fall
Bring forth the royal diadem
And crown Him Lord of all
Bring forth the royal diadem
And crown Him Lord of all

--

Ye chosen seed of Israel's race
Ye ransomed from the fall
Hail Him who saves you by His grace
And crown Him Lord of all
Hail Him who saves you by His grace
And crown Him Lord of all

--

Let every kindred every tribe
On this terrestrial ball
To Him all majesty ascribe
And crown Him Lord of all
To Him all majesty ascribe
And crown Him Lord of all

--

O that with yonder sacred throng
We at His feet may fall
We'll join the everlasting song
And crown Him Lord of all
We'll join the everlasting song
And crown Him Lord of all

Before the Throne of God Above
--

Before the throne of God above
I have a strong and perfect plea
The great High Priest whose name is Love 
Who ever lives and pleads for me

--

My name is graven on His hands 
My name is written on His heart
I know that while in heaven He stands 
No tongue can bid me thence depart
No tongue can bid me thence depart

--

When Satan tempts me to despair 
And tells me of the guilt within 
Upward I look to see Him there 
Who made an end to all my sin

--

Because the sinless Savior died 
My sinful soul is counted free 
For God the Just is satisfied 
to look on him and pardon me 
to look on him and pardon me 

--

Behold him there the risen Lamb
My perfect spotless Righteousness 
The great unchangeable I AM
The King of glory and of grace

--

One with Himself I cannot die
My soul is purchased by His blood
My life is hid with Christ on high 
with Christ my Savior and my God

--
What The Lord Has Done In Me
--

Let the weak say, "I am strong."
Let the poor say, "I am rich."
Let the blind say, "I can see;
It's what the Lord has done in me."

Hosanna, hosanna to the Lamb that was slain.
Hosanna, hosanna, Jesus died and rose again.

--

In-to the river I will wade.
There my sins are washed a-way.
From the heavens mercy streams
Of the Savior's love for me.

Hosanna, hosanna to the Lamb that was slain.
Hosanna, hosanna, Jesus died and rose again.

--

I will rise from waters deep
Into the saving arms of God.
I will sing salvation songs;
Jesus Christ has set me free.

Hosanna, hosanna to the Lamb that was slain.
Hosanna, hosanna, Jesus died and rose again.

--

Let the weak say, "I am strong."
Let the poor say, "I am rich."
Let the blind say, "I can see;
It's what the Lord has done in me."

Hosanna, hosanna to the Lamb that was slain.
Hosanna, hosanna, Jesus died and rose again.

Wonderful Maker
--

You spread out the skies over empty space 
Said "Let there be light"
To a dark and formless world
Your light was born

--

You spread out Your arms over empty hearts 
Said "Let there be light"
To a dark and hopeless world
Your Son was born

--

You made the world
And saw that it was good
You sent Your only son
For You are good

--

What a wonderful Maker 
What a wonderful Savior
How majestic Your whispers,
And how humble Your love
With a strength like no other
And the heart of a Father
How majestic Your whispers,
What a wonderful God

--

No eye has fully seen, how beautiful the cross
And we have only heard, the faintest whispers
Of how great You are

--

You made the world
And saw that it was good
You sent Your only son
For You are good

--

What a wonderful Maker 
What a wonderful Savior
How majestic Your whispers
And how humble Your love
With a strength like no other
And the heart of a Father
How majestic Your whispers
What a wonderful God

Nothing but the Blood
--

What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow.
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

For my pardon, this I see,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
For my cleansing this my plea,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow.
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

Nothing can for sin atone,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
Naught of good that I have done,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow.
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

This is all my hope and peace.
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
This is all my righteousness.
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow.
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--
There is a Fountain
--

There is a fountain filled with blood
drawn from Emmanuel's veins
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains

--

The dying thief rejoiced to see
that fountain in his day;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away

--

Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
shall never lose its power
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved, to sin no more
Be saved, to sin no more
Be saved, to sin no more
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved, to sin no more

--

E'er since, by faith, I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die
And shall be till I die
And shall be till I die
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die

--

When this poor lisping, stammering
tongue lies silent in the grave.
Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I'll sing Thy power to save
I'll sing Thy power to save
I'll sing Thy power to save
Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I'll sing Thy power to save
