And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders, wonders, of His love

Death In His Grave
--

Though the earth cried out for blood
Satisfied her hunger was
Her billows calmed on raging seas
for the souls on men she craved

--

Sun and moon from balcony
Turned their head in disbelief
Their precious love would taste the sting
disfigured and disdained

--

On Friday a thief
On Sunday a King
Laid down in grief
But awoke with the keys
Of Hell on that day
The first born of the slain
The Man Jesus Christ
Laid death in his grave

--

So three days in darkness slept
The Morning Sun of righteousness
But rose to shame the throes of death
And over turn his rule

--

Now daughters and the sons of men
Would pay not their dues again
The debt of blood they owed was rent
When the day rolled a new

--

On Friday a thief
On Sunday a King
Laid down in grief
But awoke holding the keys
To Hell on that day
The first born of the slain
The Man Jesus Christ
Laid death in his grave

--

On Friday a thief
On Sunday a King
Laid down in grief
But awoke with the keys
Of Hell on that day
The first born of the slain
The Man Jesus Christ
Laid death in his grave

--

He has cheated
Hell and seated
Us above the fall
In desperate places
He paid our wages
One time once and for all

--
I Stand Amazed
--

I stand amazed in the presence,
Of Jesus the Nazarene 
And wonder how He could love me,
A sinner condemned unclean

--

How marvelous, how wonderful 
And my song shall ever be 
How marvelous, how wonderful 
Is my Savior's love for me

--

He took my sins and my sorrows
He made them His very own 
And bore my burden to Calvary
and suffered and died alone

--

How marvelous, how wonderful 
And my song shall ever be 
How marvelous, how wonderful 
Is my Savior's love for me

--

When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see 
Twill be my joy through the ages
to sing of His love for me

--

How marvelous, how wonderful 
And my song shall ever be 
How marvelous, how wonderful 
Is my Saviors love for me

Peace on earth and mercy mild

With angelic host proclaim

Born to raise the sons of earth
Born to give them second birth
Hark the herald angels sing
"Glory to the new born King"
