Unchanging
--

Great is Your faithfulness
Great is Your faithfulness
You never change
You never fail, O God

--

True are Your promises
True are Your promises
You never change
You never fail, O God

--

So we raise up holy hands
To praise the Holy One
Who was, and is, and is to come

--

Wide is Your love and grace
Wide is Your love and grace
You never change
You never fail, O God

--

You were
You are
You will always be

--
Before the Throne of God Above
--

Before the throne of God above
I have a strong and perfect plea
The great High Priest whose name is Love 
Who ever lives and pleads for me

--

My name is graven on His hands 
My name is written on His heart
I know that while in heaven He stands 
No tongue can bid me thence depart
No tongue can bid me thence depart

--

When Satan tempts me to despair 
And tells me of the guilt within 
Upward I look to see Him there 
Who made an end to all my sin

--

Because the sinless Savior died 
My sinful soul is counted free 
For God the Just is satisfied 
to look on him and pardon me 
to look on him and pardon me 

--

Behold him there the risen Lamb
My perfect spotless Righteousness 
The great unchangeable I AM
The King of glory and of grace

--

One with Himself I cannot die
My soul is purchased by His blood
My life is hid with Christ on high 
with Christ my Savior and my God

--
Sermon
--

--
There is a Fountain
--

There is a fountain filled with blood
drawn from Emmanuel's veins
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains

--

The dying thief rejoiced to see
that fountain in his day;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away

--

Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
shall never lose its power
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved, to sin no more
Be saved, to sin no more
Be saved, to sin no more
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved, to sin no more

--

E'er since, by faith, I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die
And shall be till I die
And shall be till I die
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die

--

When this poor lisping, stammering
tongue lies silent in the grave.
Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I'll sing Thy power to save
I'll sing Thy power to save
I'll sing Thy power to save
Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I'll sing Thy power to save

The Solid Rock
--

My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus’ blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus’ name

--


On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When darkness veils His lovely face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

His oath, His covenant, His blood
Support me in the whelming flood
When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my hope and stay

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh, may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the throne

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--
The Love of Christ is Rich and Free
--

The love of Christ is rich and free; 
Fixed on His own eternally; 
Nor earth, nor hell, can it remove; 
Long as He lives, His own He’ll love.


--

His loving heart engaged to be 
Their everlasting Surety; 
’Twas love that took their cause in hand, 
And love maintains it to the end.  

--

Love cannot from its post withdraw; 
Nor death, nor hell, nor sin, nor law, 
Can turn the Surety’s heart away; 
He’ll love His own to endless day. 

--

Love has redeemed His sheep with blood; 
And love will bring them safe to God; 
Love calls them all from death to life; 
And love will finish all their strife. 

--

He loves through every changing scene, 
Nor aught from Him can Zion wean; 
Not all the wanderings of her heart 
Can make His love for her depart.

--

Love cannot from its post withdraw; 
Nor death, nor hell, nor sin, nor law, 
Can turn the Surety’s heart away; 
He’ll love His own to endless day.

--

At death, beyond the grave, He’ll love; 
In endless bliss, His own shall prove 
The blazing glory of that love 
Which never could from them remove. 

--
Victory in Jesus
--

I heard an old, old story,
How a savior came from glory
How He gave his life on Calvary
To save a wretch like me
I heard about His groaning,
His precious blood’s atoning
Then I repented of my sins
And won the victory

--

Oh victory in Jesus, my Savior forever
He sought me and bought me
With his redeeming blood
He loved me ere I knew him
And all my love is due him
He plunged me to victory
Beneath the cleansing flood

--

I heard about his healing,
Of His cleansing power revealing
How He made the lame to walk again
And caused the blind to see
And then I cried dear Jesus,
Come and heal my broken Spirit
And some how Jesus came
And bought to me the victory

--

Oh victory in Jesus, my Savior forever
He sought me and bought me
With his redeeming blood
He loved me ere I knew him
And all my love is due him
He plunged me to victory
Beneath the cleansing flood

--

I heard about a mansion
He has built for me in Glory
And I heard about the streets
Of Gold beyond the crystal sea
About the angels singing
And the old redemption story
And some sweet day I’ll sing up there
The song of victory

--

Oh victory in Jesus, my Savior forever
He sought me and bought me
With his redeeming blood
He loved me ere I knew him
And all my love is due him
He plunged me to victory
Beneath the cleansing flood
