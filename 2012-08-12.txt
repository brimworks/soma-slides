Jesus Paid It All
--

And I hear the Savior say
"Thy strength indeed is small
Child of weakness watch and pray
Find in Me thine all in all"

--

'Cause Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow
(It's washed away)
(All my sin and all my shame)

--

Lord now indeed I find
Thy pow'r and Thine alone
Can change the leper's spots
And melt the heart of stone

--

'Cause Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow
(It's washed away)
(All my sin and all my shame)

--

And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete
Jesus died my soul to save
My lips shall still repeat

--

Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow (3x)

--

Oh praise the One Who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead

Jesus

In Christ Alone
--

In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm

--

What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
My Comforter, my All in All
Here in the love of Christ I stand

--

In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save

--

Till on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

--

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again

--

And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

--

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny

--

No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand

--
Holy is the Lord
--

We stand and lift up our hands         
For the joy of the Lord is our strength
We bow down and worship Him now                      
How great how awesome is He
And together we sing

--

Holy is the Lord God Almighty   
The earth is filled with His glory  
Holy is the Lord God Almighty   
The earth is filled with His glory   
The earth is filled with His glory

--

And together we sing   
Everyone sing

The earth is filled with His glory   
Holy is the Lord God Almighty   
The earth is filled with His glory  
The earth is filled with His glory

--

It's rising up all around  
It's the anthem of the Lord's renown

--

Holy is the Lord God Almighty 
The earth is filled with His glory   
Holy is the Lord God Almighty

The earth is filled with His glory
Holy, holy is the Lord Almighty, holy, holy
