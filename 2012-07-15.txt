My God Reigns
--

There's nowhere else that I'd rather be
Than dancing with you as you sing over me
There's nothing else that I'd rather do
Lord, than to worship you

--

So rejoice, be glad,
rejoice oh my soul
For the Lord, your God,
He reigns forever more
I rejoice, for my God reigns
So rejoice, be glad,
your Father and your Friend
Is the Lord, your God,
Whose rule will never end
I rejoice, for my God reigns

--

My God reigns
And I dance the dance of praise
My God reigns
With a shout I will proclaim
My God reigns
And I worship without shame
My God reigns
And I will rejoice, for my God reigns

Mighty To Save

Everyone needs compassion
Love that's never failing
Let mercy fall on me
Everyone needs forgiveness
The kindness of a Saviour
The hope of nations

My God is mighty to save
He is mighty to save
Forever
Author of salvation
He rose and conquered the grave
Jesus conquered the grave

So take me as You find me
All my fears and failures
Fill my life again
I give my life to follow
Everything I believe in
Now I surrender

The Solid Rock
--

My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus’ blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus’ name

--


On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When darkness veils His lovely face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

His oath, His covenant, His blood
Support me in the whelming flood
When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my hope and stay

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh, may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the throne

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

Message

How Deep the Father's Love for Us
--

How deep the Father's love for us
How vast beyond all measure
That He would give His only Son
To make a wretch His treasure

--

How great the pain of searing loss
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the chosen One
Bring many sons to glory

--

Behold the Man upon a cross
My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers 

--

It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished

--

I will not boast in anything
No gifts, no powers, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection

--

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom

--
Grace Like Rain
--

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
was blind but now I see so clearly

--

Hallelujah
Grace like rain falls down on me
Hallelujah
All my stains are washed away
Washed Away

--

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

--

Hallelujah
Grace like rain falls down on me
Hallelujah
All my stains are washed away
Washed Away

--

When we've been there
Ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days
To sing Your praise
Than when we'd first begun

--

Hallelujah
Grace like rain falls down on me
Hallelujah
All my stains are washed away
Washed Away

--
Blessed Be Your Name
--

Blessed be your name,
In the land that is plentiful

Where Your streams of abundance flow
Blessed be Your name

--

Blessed be your name
When I'm found in the desert place
Though I walk through the wilderness
Blessed be Your name 

--

Every blessing You pour out
I'll turn back to praise
When the darkness closes in Lord
Still I will say

--

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your name
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your glorious name

--

Blessed be your name
When the sun's shining down on me
When the world's all as it should be
Blessed be your name

--

Blessed be your name
On the road marked with suffering
Though there's pain in the offering
Blessed be your name

--

Every blessing You pour out I'll
turn back to praise
When the darkness closes in, Lord
Still I will say...

--

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your name
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your glorious name

--

You give and take away
You give and take away
My heart will choose to say
Lord Blessed be your name

--

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your name
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your glorious name
