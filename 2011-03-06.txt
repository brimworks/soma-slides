Arms of Love
--

I sing a simple song of love
To my Savior, to my Jesus
I'm grateful for the things You've done
My loving Savior oh precious Jesus

--

My heart is glad
that You've called me Your own
And there's no place I'd rather be

--

Than in Your arms of love
In Your arms of love
Holding me still holding me near
In Your arms of love

--

I sing a simple song of love
To my Savior, to my Jesus
I'm grateful for the things You've done
My loving Savior oh precious Jesus

--

My heart is glad
that You've called me Your own
And there's no place I'd rather be

--

Than in Your arms of love
In Your arms of love
Holding me still holding me near
In Your arms of love

Be Thou My Vision
--

Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart
Nought be all else to me, save that Thou are;
Thou my best thought, by day or by night
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

--

Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

--

Riches I heed not, nor man’s empty praise
Thou mine inheritance, now and always;
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart
High King of heaven, my Treasure Thou art.

--

High King of heaven, my victory won,
May I reach heaven’s joys, O bright heaven’s Sun!
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.

Thoughts of You
--

Thoughts of You and how You changed me 
Fill my mind 
Without You where would I be

--

So even though I've tried
to express my thanks 
It never comes out how I hoped 
I want to say so much more
so with these simple words I'll try

--

I love You 
My heart is Yours, only Yours 
I long to give You all of me 
My everything, my everything

--

You still loved me even when I 
Pushed You away 
You stood there and waited 
Till the day I'd return

--

God I never could repay You 
You gave everything 
Without You where would I be 

--

So even though I've tried
to express my thanks 
It never comes out how I hoped 
I want to say so much more
so with these simple words I'll try

--

I love You 
My heart is Yours, only Yours 
I long to give You all of me 
My everything, my everything

--
Living Water
--

How lovely is Your dwelling place
Oh Lord God Almighty
My soul yearns, it even faints
For the courts of the Lord

--

You fill my soul with Your living water and I, 
am your child
You fill my soul with Your living water and I, 
am your child

--

Oh Lord, God who saves me,
Day and night I cry out before You
May my prayer come before You
Turn Your ear to my cry

--

You fill my soul with Your living water and I, 
am your child
You fill my soul with Your living water and I, 
am your child

Hallelujah...

Blessed Be Your Name
--

Blessed be your name,
In the land that is plentiful

Where Your streams of abundance flow
Blessed be Your name

--

Blessed be your name
When I'm found in the desert place
Though I walk through the wilderness
Blessed be Your name 

--

Every blessing You pour out
I'll turn back to praise
When the darkness closes in Lord
Still I will say

--

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your name
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your glorious name

--

Blessed be your name
When the sun's shining down on me
When the world's all as it should be
Blessed be your name

--

Blessed be your name
On the road marked with suffering
Though there's pain in the offering
Blessed be your name

--

Every blessing You pour out I'll
turn back to praise
When the darkness closes in, Lord
Still I will say...

--

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your name
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your glorious name

--

You give and take away
You give and take away
My heart will choose to say
Lord Blessed be your name

--

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your name
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your glorious name

Strong Tower
--

When I wander through the desert
And I'm longing for my home
All my dreams have gone astray
When I'm stranded in the valley
And I'm tired and all alone
It seems like I've lost my way

--

I go running to Your Mountain
Where your mercy sets me free...

--

You are my strong tower
Shelter over me
Beautiful and mighty
Everlasting King
You are my strong tower
Fortress when I'm weak
Your name is true and holy
And Your face is all I seek

--

In the middle of my darkness
In the midst of all my fear
You're my refuge and my hope
When the storm of life is raging
And the thunder's all I hear
You speak softly to my soul

--

I go running to Your Mountain
Where your mercy sets me free...

--

You are my strong tower
Shelter over me
Beautiful and mighty
Everlasting King
You are my strong tower
Fortress when I'm weak
Your name is true and holy
And Your face is all I seek

--

When I wander through the desert
And I'm longing for my home
All my dreams have gone astray
When I'm stranded in the valley
And I'm tired and all alone
It seems like I've lost my way

--

I go running to Your Mountain
Where your mercy sets me free...

--

You are my strong tower
Shelter over me
Beautiful and mighty
Everlasting King
You are my strong tower
Fortress when I'm weak
Your name is true and holy
And Your face is all I seek
