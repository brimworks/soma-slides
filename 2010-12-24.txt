What Child Is This
--

What child is this, who, laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?

--

This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The baby, the son of Mary

--

Why lies He in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christian fear, for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading.

--

This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The baby, the son of Mary

--

So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh
Come, peasant, king, to own Him
The King of Kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him

--

Raise, raise the song on high
The Virgin sings her lullaby
Joy! joy! for Christ is born
The babe, the son of Mary

--

This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The baby, the son of Mary

Silent Night
--

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, All is bright
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy Infant so Tender and mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace,
Sleep in heavenly peace.

--

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight,
Glories stream from heaven afar,
Heavenly hosts sing Alleleu- lia
Christ the Saviour is born!
Christ the saviour is born.

--

Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
with the dawn of redeeming grace,
Jesus Lord at thy birth,
Jesus Lord at thy birth. 

--
O Holy Night
--

O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Saviour's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks, a new and glorious morn

--

Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices
O night divine, O night when Christ was born
O night, O holy night, O night divine

--

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here came the wise men from Orient land
The King of Kings, lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friend

--

He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger
Behold, your King, before Him lowly bend
Behold, your King, before Him lowly bend

--


Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love, and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name

--

Christ is the Lord, O praise His name forever
His power and glory
ever more proclaim

--
How Many Kings
--

Follow the star to a place unexpected
Would you believe after all we've projected
A child in a manger?
Lowly and small, the weakest of all
Unlikeliest hero, wrapped in his mother's shawl
Just a child
Is this who we've waited for? Cuz ...

--

How many kings step down from their thrones?
How many lords have abandoned their homes?
How many greats have become the least for me?
And how many gods have poured out their hearts
To romance a world that is torn all apart
How many fathers gave up their sons for me?

--

Bringing our gifts for the newborn Savior
All that we have, whether costly or meek
Because we believe
Gold for His honor and frankincense for His pleasure
And myrrh for the cross Heâ€™ll suffer
Do you believe?
Is this who we've waited for?

--

How many kings step down from their thrones?
How many lords have abandoned their homes?
How many greats have become the least for me?
And how many gods have poured out their hearts
To romance a world that is torn all apart
How many fathers gave up their sons for me?

--

Only one did that for me
Oh, all for me, Oh
All for me, all for you
All for me, all for you

--

How many kings step down from their thrones?
How many lords have abandoned their homes?
How many greats have become the least for me?
And how many gods have poured out their hearts
To romance a world that is torn all apart
How many fathers gave up their sons for me?

--
Joy to the World
--

Joy to the word, the Lord is come!
Let earth receive her King;
Let every heart prepare Him room,
And heaven and nature sing,
And heaven and nature sing,
And heaven, and heaven, and nature sing.

--

Joy to the world, the Savior reigns!
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy

--

He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness,
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders, wonders, of His love
