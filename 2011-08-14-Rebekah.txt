Nothing but the Blood
--

What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

--

Oh precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

--

For my pardon this I see
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
For my cleansing this my plea
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

--

Oh precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

--

Nothing can for sin atone
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Naught of good that I have done
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

--

Oh precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

--

This is all my hope and peace
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
This is all my righteousness
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

--

Oh precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

--
Before the Throne of God Above
--

Before the throne of God above
I have a strong and perfect plea
The great High Priest whose name is Love 
Who ever lives and pleads for me

--

My name is graven on His hands 
My name is written on His heart
I know that while in heaven He stands 
No tongue can bid me thence depart
No tongue can bid me thence depart

--

When Satan tempts me to despair 
And tells me of the guilt within 
Upward I look to see Him there 
Who made an end to all my sin

--

Because the sinless Savior died 
My sinful soul is counted free 
For God the Just is satisfied 
to look on him and pardon me 
to look on him and pardon me 

--

Behold him there the risen Lamb
My perfect spotless Righteousness 
The great unchangeable I AM
The King of glory and of grace

--

One with Himself I cannot die
My soul is purchased by His blood
My life is hid with Christ on high 
with Christ my Savior and my God

--
Man of Sorrows
--

Man of sorrows what a Name
For the Son of God Who came
Ruined sinners to reclaim
Hallelujah what a Saviour

--

Bearing shame 
and scoffing rude
In my place 
condemned He stood
Sealed my pardon 
with His Blood
Hallelujah what a Saviour

--

Guilty vile and helpless we
Spotless Lamb of God was He
Full atonement can it be
Hallelujah what a Saviour

--

Lifted up was He to die
It is finished was His Cry
Now in Heaven exalted high
Hallelujah what a Saviour

--

When He comes 
our Glorious King
All His ransomed home to bring
Then anew this song we'll sing
Hallelujah what a Saviour

--
Praise To The Lord
--

Praise to the Lord,
the Almighty, the King of creation!
O my soul, praise Him,
for He is thy health and salvation!
All ye who hear,
now to His temple draw near

--

Praise to the Lord,
Who hath fearfully, wondrously, made thee;
Health hath vouch safed and,
When heedlessly falling, hath stayed thee
What need or grief
ever hath failed of relief?

--

Praise Him, Praise Him
Praise Him, Praise Him
Praise Him, Praise Him
Praise Him

--

Praise to the Lord,
who, when tempests their warfare are waging,  
Who, when the elements
madly around thee are raging,  
Biddeth them cease,
turneth their fury to peace,

--

Praise Him, Praise Him
Praise Him, Praise Him
Praise Him, Praise Him
Praise Him

Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation...

How Great Thou Art
--

O Lord my God,
When I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the worlds
Thy Hands have made;
I see the stars,
I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout
the universe displayed.

--

Then sings my soul,
My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul,
My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.

--

When through the woods,
and forest glades I wander,
And hear the birds
sing sweetly in the trees.
When I look down,
from lofty mountain grandeur
And see the brook,
and feel the gentle breeze.

--

Then sings my soul,
My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul,
My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.

--

And when I think,
that God, His Son not sparing;
Sent Him to die,
I scarce can take it in;
That on the Cross,
my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died
to take away my sin.

--

Then sings my soul,
My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul,
My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.

--

When Christ shall come,
with shout of acclamation,
And take me home,
what joy shall fill my heart.
Then I shall bow,
in humble adoration,
And then proclaim:
"My God, how great Thou art!"

--

Then sings my soul,
My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul,
My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.
