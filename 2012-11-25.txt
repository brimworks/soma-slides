O For a Thousand Tongues
--

O, for a thousand tongues to sing
My great redeemers praise
The glories of my God and King
The triumphs of His grace

--

My gracious Master and my God
Assist me to proclaim
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honors of Thy name

--

So praise the name of Jesus!
So praise the name of Jesus!

--

Jesus the name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease,
Tis music in the sinner ears,
Tis life and health and peace.

--

He breaks the power of cancelled sin
He sets the prisoners free
His blood can make the foulest clean
His blood availed for me

--

So praise the name of Jesus!
So praise the name of Jesus!

--

He speaks, and, listening to His voice,
New life the dead receive,
The mournful, broken hearts rejoice,
The humble poor believe.

--

Glory to God and praise and love
Be ever, ever given
By saints below and saints above
The church in earth and Heaven

--

So praise the name of Jesus!
So praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

Before The Throne Of God Above
--

Before the throne of God above
I have a strong and perfect plea
The great High Priest whose name is Love 
Who ever lives and pleads for me

--

My name is graven on His hands 
My name is written on His heart
I know that while in heaven He stands 
No tongue can bid me thence depart
No tongue can bid me thence depart

--

When Satan tempts me to despair 
And tells me of the guilt within 
Upward I look to see Him there 
Who made an end to all my sin

--

Because the sinless Savior died 
My sinful soul is counted free 
For God the Just is satisfied 
to look on him and pardon me 
to look on him and pardon me 

--

Behold him there the risen Lamb
My perfect spotless Righteousness 
The great unchangeable I AM
The King of glory and of grace

--

One with Himself I cannot die
My soul is purchased by His blood
My life is hid with Christ on high 
with Christ my Savior and my God

--
The Solid Rock
--

My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus' name

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When darkness veils His lovely face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

His oath, His covenant, His blood
Support me in the whelming flood
When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my hope and stay

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh, may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the throne

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

Message

How Deep the Father's Love for Us
--

How deep the Father's love for us
How vast beyond all measure
That He should give His only Son
And make a wretch His treasure

--

How great the pain of searing loss
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the chosen One
Bring many sons to glory

--

Behold the Man upon the cross
My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers 

--

It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished

--

I will not boast in anything
No gifts, no power, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection

--

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom

--
Jesus Paid it All
--

I hear the Savior say,
Thy Strength indeed is small                  
Child of weakness watch and pray
Find in Me thine all in all
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
Sin has left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy power and Thine alone          
Can change the lepers spots
And melt the heart of stone   
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
Sin has left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete          
Jesus died my soul to save,
My lips shall still repeat   
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
Sin has left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

O praise the one who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead

--
The Love of Christ is Rich and Free
--

The love of Christ is rich and free; 
Fixed on His own eternally; 
Nor earth, nor hell, can it remove; 
Long as He lives, His own He'll love.

--

His loving heart engaged to be 
Their everlasting Surety; 
'Twas love that took their cause in hand, 
And love maintains it to the end.  

--

Love cannot from its post withdraw; 
Nor death, nor hell, nor sin, nor law, 
Can turn the Surety's heart away; 
He'll love His own to endless day. 

--

Love has redeemed His sheep with blood; 
And love will bring them safe to God; 
Love calls them all from death to life; 
And love will finish all their strife. 

--

He loves through every changing scene, 
Nor aught from Him can Zion wean; 
Not all the wanderings of her heart 
Can make His love for her depart.

--

Love cannot from its post withdraw; 
Nor death, nor hell, nor sin, nor law, 
Can turn the Surety's heart away; 
He'll love His own to endless day.

--

At death, beyond the grave, He'll love; 
In endless bliss, His own shall prove 
The blazing glory of that love 
Which never could from them remove.
