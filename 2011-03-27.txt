Here I am To Worship
--

Light of the world 
You stepped down into darkness 
Opened my eyes, let me see 
Beauty that made this heart adore you
Hope of a life spent with You 

--

So here I am to worship 
Here I am to bow down 
Here I am to say that You're my God 
You're altogether lovely,
altogether worthy
You are altogether wonderful to me 

--

King of all days 
Oh so highly exalted 
Glorious in Heaven above 
Humbly You came to the earth You created 
All for love's sake became poor

--

So here I am to worship 
Here I am to bow down 
Here I am to say that You're my God 
You're altogether lovely,
altogether worthy
You are altogether wonderful to me 

--

I'll never know, how much it cost 
To see my sin upon that cross

--

So here I am to worship 
Here I am to bow down 
Here I am to say that You're my God 
You're altogether lovely,
altogether worthy
You are altogether wonderful to me

Light of the world 
You stepped down into darkness 
Opened my eyes, let me see

Kindness
--

Open up the skies of mercy
Rain down the cleansing flood
Healing waters rise around us
Hear our cries Lord, let Ã¢'em rise.

--

It's Your kindness, Lord,
that leads us to repentance
Your favor, Lord, is our desire
It's Your beauty, Lord,
that makes us stand in silence
Your love, Your Love is better than life

--

We can feel, Your mercy falling
You are turning our hearts back again.
Hear our praises rise to heaven,
Draw us near, Lord
Meet us here. 

--

It's Your kindness, Lord,
that leads us to repentance
Your favor, Lord, is our desire
It's Your beauty, Lord,
that makes us stand in silence
Your love, Your Love is better than life

Refine Me
--

I come into this place
Burning to receive your peace
I come with my own chains
From wars I've fought for my own selfish gain

--

You're my God and my Father
I've accepted your Son
But my soul feels so empty now
What have I become

--

Lord come with Your fire
Burn my desires refine me
Lord my will has deceived me
Please come and free me refine me

--

My heart can't see
When I only look at me
My soul can't hear
When I only think of my own fears

But they are gone in a moment
You're forever the same
Why did I look away from You
How can I speak Your name

--

Lord come with Your fire
Burn my desires refine me
Lord my will has deceived me
Please come and free me
Come rescue this child
For I long to be reconciled to You

--

It's all I can do
To give my heart and soul to You and pray
And pray oh I will pray

--

Lord come with Your fire
Burn my desires refine me
Lord my will has deceived me
Please come and free me
Come rescue this child
For I long to be reconciled to You

Refine me, refine me
Refine me, refine me

--
Better is One Day
--

How lovely is your dwelling place
Oh Lord Almighty 
My soul longs and even faints for You
For here my heart is satisfied  
Within your presence
I sing beneath the shadow of your wings

--

Better is one day in your courts
Better is one day in your house
Better is one day in your courts
Than thousands elsewhere

--

One thing I ask and I would seek
To see your beauty
To find you in the place your glory dwells

--

Better is one day in your courts
Better is one day in your house
Better is one day in your courts
Than thousands elsewhere

--

My heart and flesh cry out
For you the living God
Your spirit's water for my soul
I've tasted and I've seen
Come once again to me
I will draw near to you
I will draw near to you

--

Better is one day in your courts
Better is one day in your house
Better is one day in your courts
Than thousands elsewhere

--
Arms of Love
--

I sing a simple song of love
To my Savior, to my Jesus
I'm grateful for the things You've done
My loving Savior oh precious Jesus

--

My heart is glad
that You've called me Your own
And there's no place I'd rather be

--

Than in Your arms of love
In Your arms of love
Holding me still holding me near
In Your arms of love

Rain
--

When I wake, You're there
When I run, You run for me
When I call, You listen

--

Just to believe that You want me
Makes me think
I'm bound to know You

Rain down on me
Give me the eyes to see
Rain down on me
And I will believe
