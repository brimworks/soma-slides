O For a Thousand Tongues
--

O, for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer praise
The glories of my God and King
The triumphs of His grace

--

My gracious Master and my God
Assist me to proclaim
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honors of Thy name

--

Jesus! The name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease,
Tis music in the sinner ears,
Tis life and health and peace.

--

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

--

He breaks the power of cancelled sin
He sets the prisoners free
His blood can make the foulest clean
His blood availed for me

--

Here Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb,
Your loosened tongues employ;
Ye blind, behold your Savior come;
And leap, ye lame, for joy.

--

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

--

Glory to God and praise and love
Be ever, ever given
By saints below and saints above
The church in earth and Heaven

--

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

The Love of Christ is Rich and Free
--

The love of Christ is rich and free
Fixed on His own eternally
Nor earth, nor hell, can it remove
Long as He lives, His own He’ll love

--

His loving heart engaged to be 
Their everlasting Surety
’Twas love that took their cause in hand
And love maintains it to the end 

--

Love cannot from its post withdraw
Nor death, nor hell, nor sin, nor law
Can turn the Surety’s heart away 
He’ll love His own to endless day

--

Love has redeemed His sheep with blood
And love will bring them safe to God
Love calls them all from death to life
And love will finish all their strife

--

He loves through every changing scene
Nor aught from Him can Zion wean 
Not all the wanderings of her heart 
Can make His love for her depart

--

Love cannot from its post withdraw
Nor death, nor hell, nor sin, nor law 
Can turn the Surety’s heart away
He’ll love His own to endless day

--

At death, beyond the grave, He’ll love
In endless bliss, His own shall prove 
The blazing glory of that love 
Which never could from them remove

--
In Christ Alone
--

In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm

--

What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
My Comforter, my All in All
Here in the love of Christ I stand

--

In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save

--

Till on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

--

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again

--

And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

--

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny

--

No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand

Wonderful Maker
--

You spread out the skies over empty space 
Said "Let there be light"
To a dark and formless world
Your light was born

--

You spread out Your arms over empty hearts 
Said "Let there be light"
To a dark and hopeless world
Your Son was born

--

You made the world
And saw that it was good
You sent Your only son
For You are good

--

What a wonderful Maker 
What a wonderful Savior
How majestic Your whispers,
And how humble Your love
With a strength like no other
And the heart of a Father
How majestic Your whispers,
What a wonderful God

--

No eye has fully seen, how beautiful the cross
And we have only heard, the faintest whispers
Of how great You are

--

You made the world
And saw that it was good
You sent Your only son
For You are good

--

What a wonderful Maker 
What a wonderful Savior
How majestic Your whispers
And how humble Your love
With a strength like no other
And the heart of a Father
How majestic Your whispers
What a wonderful God

Nothing but the Blood

What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow.
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

For my pardon, this I see,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
For my cleansing this my plea,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow.
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

Nothing can for sin atone,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
Naught of good that I have done,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow.
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

This is all my hope and peace.
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
This is all my righteousness.
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow.
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
