The Solid Rock
--

My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus' name

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When darkness veils His lovely face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

His oath, His covenant, His blood
Support me in the whelming flood
When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my hope and stay

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh, may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the throne

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--
O For a Thousand Tongues
--

O, for a thousand tongues to sing
My great redeemers praise
The glories of my God and King
The triumphs of His grace

--

My gracious Master and my God
Assist me to proclaim
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honors of Thy name

--

So praise the name of Jesus!
So praise the name of Jesus!

--

Jesus the name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease,
Tis music in the sinner ears,
Tis life and health and peace.

--

He breaks the power of cancelled sin
He sets the prisoners free
His blood can make the foulest clean
His blood availed for me

--

So praise the name of Jesus!
So praise the name of Jesus!

--

He speaks, and, listening to His voice,
New life the dead receive,
The mournful, broken hearts rejoice,
The humble poor believe.

--

Glory to God and praise and love
Be ever, ever given
By saints below and saints above
The church in earth and Heaven

--

So praise the name of Jesus!
So praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

Death In His Grave
--

Though the earth cried out for blood
Satisfied her hunger was
Her billows calmed on raging seas
for the souls on men she craved

--

Sun and moon from balcony
Turned their head in disbelief
Their precious love would taste the sting
disfigured and disdained

--

On Friday a thief
On Sunday a King
Laid down in grief
But awoke with the keys
Of Hell on that day
The first born of the slain
The Man Jesus Christ
Laid death in his grave

--

So three days in darkness slept
The Morning Sun of righteousness
But rose to shame the throes of death
And over turn his rule

--

Now daughters and the sons of men
Would pay not their dues again
The debt of blood they owed was rent
When the day rolled a new

--

On Friday a thief
On Sunday a King
Laid down in grief
But awoke holding the keys
To Hell on that day
The first born of the slain
The Man Jesus Christ
Laid death in his grave

--

On Friday a thief
On Sunday a King
Laid down in grief
But awoke with the keys
Of Hell on that day
The first born of the slain
The Man Jesus Christ
Laid death in his grave

--

He has cheated
Hell and seated
Us above the fall
In desperate places
He paid our wages
One time once and for all

--
Jesus Paid it All
--

I hear the Savior say,
Thy Strength indeed is small                  
Child of weakness watch and pray
Find in Me thine all in all
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
Sin has left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy power and Thine alone          
Can change the lepers spots
And melt the heart of stone   
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
Sin has left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete          
Jesus died my soul to save,
My lips shall still repeat   
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
Sin has left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

O praise the one who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead

--
The Love of Christ is Rich and Free
--

The love of Christ is rich and free; 
Fixed on His own eternally; 
Nor earth, nor hell, can it remove; 
Long as He lives, His own He'll love.

--

His loving heart engaged to be 
Their everlasting Surety; 
'Twas love that took their cause in hand, 
And love maintains it to the end.  

--

Love cannot from its post withdraw; 
Nor death, nor hell, nor sin, nor law, 
Can turn the Surety's heart away; 
He'll love His own to endless day. 

--

Love has redeemed His sheep with blood; 
And love will bring them safe to God; 
Love calls them all from death to life; 
And love will finish all their strife. 

--

He loves through every changing scene, 
Nor aught from Him can Zion wean; 
Not all the wanderings of her heart 
Can make His love for her depart.

--

Love cannot from its post withdraw; 
Nor death, nor hell, nor sin, nor law, 
Can turn the Surety's heart away; 
He'll love His own to endless day.

--

At death, beyond the grave, He'll love; 
In endless bliss, His own shall prove 
The blazing glory of that love 
Which never could from them remove.
