O For a Thousand Tongues
--

O, for a thousand tongues to sing
My great redeemers praise
The glories of my God and King
The triumphs of His grace

--

My gracious Master and my God
Assist me to proclaim
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honors of Thy name

--

Jesus the name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease,
Tis music in the sinner ears,
Tis life and health and peace.

--

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

--

He breaks the power of cancelled sin
He sets the prisoners free
His blood can make the foulest clean
His blood availed for me

--

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

--

Glory to God and praise and love
Be ever, ever given
By saints below and saints above
The church in earth and Heaven

--

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

--
The Solid Rock
--

My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus' name

--


On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When darkness veils His lovely face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

His oath, His covenant, His blood
Support me in the whelming flood
When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my hope and stay

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh, may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the throne

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

Sermon

Sermon

--
How Deep the Father's Love for Us
--

How deep the Father's love for us
How vast beyond all measure
That He would give His only Son
To make a wretch His treasure

--

How great the pain of searing loss
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the chosen One
Bring many sons to glory

--

Behold the Man upon a cross
My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers 

--

It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished

--

I will not boast in anything
No gifts, no powers, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection

--

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom

--
How Great Thou Art
--

O Lord my God,
When I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the worlds
Thy Hands have made;
I see the stars,
I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout
the universe displayed.

--

Then sings my soul,
My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul,
My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.

--

And when I think,
that God, His Son not sparing;
Sent Him to die,
I scarce can take it in;
That on the Cross,
my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died
to take away my sin.

--

Then sings my soul,
My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul,
My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.

--

When Christ shall come,
with shout of acclamation,
And take me home,
what joy shall fill my heart.
Then I shall bow,
in humble adoration,
And then proclaim:
"My God, how great Thou art!"

--

Then sings my soul,
My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul,
My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.

Unchanging
--

Great is Your faithfulness
Great is Your faithfulness
You never change
You never fail, O God

--

True are Your promises
True are Your promises
You never change
You never fail, O God

--

So we raise up holy hands
To praise the Holy One
Who was, and is, and is to come

--

Wide is Your love and grace
Wide is Your love and grace
You never change
You never fail, O God

--

You were
You are
You will always be

--
I Stand Amazed (How Marvelous)
--

I stand amazed in the presence,
Of Jesus the Nazarene 
And wonder how He could love me,
A sinner condemned unclean

--

How marvelous, how wonderful 
And my song shall ever be 
How marvelous, how wonderful 
Is my Savior's love for me

--

He took my sins and my sorrows
He made them His very own 
And bore my burden to Calvary
and suffered and died alone

--

How marvelous, how wonderful 
And my song shall ever be 
How marvelous, how wonderful 
Is my Saviors love for me

--

When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see 
Twill be my joy through the ages
to sing of His love for me

--

How marvelous, how wonderful 
And my song shall ever be 
How marvelous, how wonderful 
Is my Saviors love for me
