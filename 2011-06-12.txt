Blessed Be Your Name
--

Blessed be your name,
In the land that is plentiful
Where Your streams of abundance flow
Blessed be Your name

--

Blessed be your name
When I'm found in the desert place
Though I walk through the wilderness
Blessed be Your name 

--

Every blessing You pour out
I'll turn back to praise
When the darkness closes in Lord
Still I will say

--

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your way
My heart will always say,
Lord Blessed be your name

--

Blessed be your name
When the sun's shining down on me
When the world's all as it should be
Blessed be your name

--

Blessed be your name
On the road marked with suffering
Though there's pain in the offering
Blessed be your name

--

Every blessing You pour out I'll
turn back to praise
When the darkness closes in, Lord
Still I will say...

--

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your way
My heart will always say,
Lord Blessed be your name

--

You give and take away
You give and take away
My heart will always say
Lord Blessed be your name
(2x)

--

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your way
My heart will always say,
Lord Blessed be your name

Here I am To Worship
--

Light of the world 
You stepped down into darkness 
Opened my eyes, let me see 
Beauty that made this heart adore you
Hope of a life spent with You 

--

So here I am to worship 
Here I am to bow down 
Here I am to say that You're my God 
You're altogether lovely,
altogether worthy
You are altogether wonderful to me 

--

King of all days 
Oh so highly exalted 
Glorious in Heaven above 
Humbly You came to the earth You created 
All for love's sake became poor

--

So here I am to worship 
Here I am to bow down 
Here I am to say that You're my God 
You're altogether lovely,
altogether worthy
You are altogether wonderful to me 

--

I'll never know, how much it cost 
To see my sin upon that cross

--

So here I am to worship 
Here I am to bow down 
Here I am to say that You're my God 
You're altogether lovely,
altogether worthy
You are altogether wonderful to me 

--

Light of the world 
You stepped down into darkness 
Opened my eyes, let me see

--
Thoughts of You
--

Thoughts of You and how You changed me 
Fill my mind 
Without You where would I be

--

So even though I've tried
to express my thanks 
It never comes out how I hoped 
I want to say so much more
so with these simple words I'll try

--

I love You 
My heart is Yours, only Yours 
I long to give You all of me 
My everything, my everything

--

You still loved me even when I 
Pushed You away 
You stood there and waited 
Till the day I'd return

--

God I never could repay You 
You gave everything 
Without You where would I be 

--

So even though I've tried
to express my thanks 
It never comes out how I hoped 
I want to say so much more
so with these simple words I'll try

--

I love You 
My heart is Yours, only Yours 
I long to give You all of me 
My everything, my everything

--
Living Water
--

How lovely is Your dwelling place
Oh Lord God Almighty
My soul yearns, it even faints
For the courts of the Lord

--

You fill my soul with Your living water and I, 
am your child
You fill my soul with Your living water and I, 
am your child

--

Oh Lord, God who saves me,
Day and night I cry out before You
May my prayer come before You
Turn Your ear to my cry

--

You fill my soul with Your living water and I, 
am your child
You fill my soul with Your living water and I, 
am your child

Hallelujah...

--
My God My Father
--

My God, my Father while I stray
Far from my home in life's rough way
O teach me from my heart to say
Thy will be done

--

Though dark my path, and sad my lot
Let me be still, and murmur not
Or breathe the prayer divinely taught
Thy will be done!

--

But if my fainting heart be blessed
With the Holy Spirit for its guest
My God to Thee I leave the rest
Thy will be done!

--

If Thou should call me to resign
What most I prize, never was mine
I only yield Thee what is Thine
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!

--

Renew my will from day to day
Blend it with Thine and take away
All that now makes it hard to say
Thy will be done!
(2x)

--

Then when on earth I breathe no more
The prayer oft mixed with tears before
I'll sing upon that joyful shore
Thy will be done!

--

My God, my Father while I stray
Far from my home in life's rough way
O teach me from my heart to say
Thy will be done

--

Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!

The earth is filled with His glory
The earth is filled with His glory
