O For a Thousand Tongues
--

O, for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer praise
The glories of my God and King
The triumphs of His grace

--

My gracious Master and my God
Assist me to proclaim
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honors of Thy name

--

Jesus! The name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease,
Tis music in the sinner ears,
Tis life and health and peace.

--

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

--

He breaks the power of cancelled sin
He sets the prisoners free
His blood can make the foulest clean
His blood availed for me

--

Here Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb,
Your loosened tongues employ;
Ye blind, behold your Savior come;
And leap, ye lame, for joy.

--

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

--

Glory to God and praise and love
Be ever, ever given
By saints below and saints above
The church in earth and Heaven

--

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

--
Jesus Paid it All
--

I hear the Savior say,
Thy Strength indeed is small                  
Child of weakness watch and pray
Find in Me thine all in all
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
My sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy power and Thine alone          
Can change the lepers spots
And melt the heart of stone   
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
My sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete          
Jesus died my soul to save,
My lips shall still repeat   
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
My sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

O praise the one who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead

House Of God Forever 
--

God is my Shepherd
I won't be wanting,
I won't be wanting
He makes me rest
In fields of green by quiet streams

--

Even though I walk
Through the valley of death and dying
I will not fear
For You are with me,
You're always with me

--

Your Shepherd's staff comforts me
You are my feast in the presence of enemies
Surely goodness will follow me, follow me
In the House of God, forever

--

God is my Shepherd
I won't be wanting,
I won't be wanting
He makes me rest
In fields of green by quiet streams

--

Even though I walk
Through the valley of death and dying
I will not fear
For You are with me,
You're always with me

--

Your Shepherd's staff comforts me
You are my feast in the presence of enemies
Surely goodness will follow me, follow me
In the House of God, forever

Psalm 27
--

The Lord is the light of my Salvation,
The Lord is the strength of my life,
Whom shall I fear, of whom shall I be afraid,
Whom shall I fear, O Lord
Whom shall I fear, whom shall I fear,
Of whom shall I be afraid?

--
The Solid Rock
--

My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus’ blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus’ name

--


On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When darkness veils His lovely face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

His oath, His covenant, His blood
Support me in the whelming flood
When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my hope and stay

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--

When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh, may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the throne

--

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

--
How Firm a Foundation
--

How firm a foundation
ye saints of the Lord 
is laid for your faith
in his excellent word!
What more can he say
than to you he hath said, 
to you who for refuge
to Jesus have fled?

--

Fear not, I am with thee
Oh, be not dismayed
For I am thy God, and
will still give thee aid
I'll strengthen and help thee
and cause thee to stand 
upheld by my righteous
omnipotent hand

--

When through deep waters 
I call thee to go
the rivers of woe
shall not thee overflow
For I will be with thee 
thy troubles to bless 
and sanctify to thee
thy deepest distress

--

When through fiery trials
thy pathways shall lie 
My grace all-sufficient
shall be thy supply
The flame shall not harm
thee I only design 
Thy dross to consume
and thy gold to refine
