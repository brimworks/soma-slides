Before The Throne Of God Above
--

Before the throne of God above
I have a strong and perfect plea
The great High Priest whose name is Love 
Who ever lives and pleads for me

--

My name is graven on His hands 
My name is written on His heart
I know that while in heaven He stands 
No tongue can bid me thence depart
No tongue can bid me thence depart

--

When Satan tempts me to despair 
And tells me of the guilt within 
Upward I look to see Him there 
Who made an end to all my sin

--

Because the sinless Savior died 
My sinful soul is counted free 
For God the Just is satisfied 
to look on him and pardon me 
to look on him and pardon me 

--

Behold him there the risen Lamb
My perfect spotless Righteousness 
The great unchangeable I AM
The King of glory and of grace

--

One with Himself I cannot die
My soul is purchased by His blood
My life is hid with Christ on high 
with Christ my Savior and my God

--
Be Thou My Vision
--

Be Thou my vision O Lord of my heart
Nought be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best thought by day or by night
Waking or sleeping Thy presence my light

--

Be Thou my Wisdom and Thou my true Word
I ever with Thee and Thou with me Lord
Thou my great Father I Thy true son
Thou in me dwelling and I with Thee one

--

Riches I heed not nor mans empty praise
Thou mine inheritance now and always
Thou and Thou only first in my heart
High King of heaven my treasure Thou art

--

High King of heaven, my victory won
May I reach heavens joys
O bright heavens sun!
Heart of my own heart whatever befall
Still be my vision O ruler of all

Death In His Grave
--

Though the earth cried out for blood
Satisfied her hunger was
Her billows calmed on raging seas
for the souls on men she craved

--

Sun and moon from balcony
Turned their head in disbelief
Their precious love would taste the sting
disfigured and disdained

--

On Friday a thief
On Sunday a King
Laid down in grief
But awoke with the keys
Of Hell on that day
The first born of the slain
The Man Jesus Christ
Laid death in his grave

--

So three days in darkness slept
The Morning Sun of righteousness
But rose to shame the throes of death
And over turn his rule

--

Now daughters and the sons of men
Would pay not their dues again
The debt of blood they owed was rent
When the day rolled a new

--

On Friday a thief
On Sunday a King
Laid down in grief
But awoke holding the keys
To Hell on that day
The first born of the slain
The Man Jesus Christ
Laid death in his grave

--

On Friday a thief
On Sunday a King
Laid down in grief
But awoke with the keys
Of Hell on that day
The first born of the slain
The Man Jesus Christ
Laid death in his grave

--

He has cheated
Hell and seated
Us above the fall
In desperate places
He paid our wages
One time once and for all

--
How Deep the Father's Love for Us
--

How deep the Father's love for us
How vast beyond all measure
That He should give His only Son
And make a wretch His treasure

--

How great the pain of searing loss
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the chosen One
Bring many sons to glory

--

Behold the Man upon the cross
My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers 

--

It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished

--

I will not boast in anything
No gifts, no power, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection

--

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom

--
Jesus Paid it All
--

I hear the Savior say,
Thy Strength indeed is small                  
Child of weakness watch and pray
Find in Me thine all in all
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
Sin has left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy power and Thine alone          
Can change the lepers spots
And melt the heart of stone   
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
Sin has left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete          
Jesus died my soul to save,
My lips shall still repeat   
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe
Sin has left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

--

O praise the one who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead
