Be Thou My Vision
--

Be Thou my vision O Lord of my heart
Nought be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best thought by day or by night
Waking or sleeping Thy presence my light

--

Be Thou my Wisdom and Thou my true Word
I ever with Thee and Thou with me Lord
Thou my great Father I Thy true son
Thou in me dwelling and I with Thee one

--

Riches I heed not nor mans empty praise
Thou mine inheritance now and always
Thou and Thou only first in my heart
High King of heaven my treasure Thou art

--

High King of heaven, my victory won
May I reach heavens joys
O bright heavens sun!
Heart of my own heart whatever befall
Still be my vision O ruler of all

Jesus Paid It All
--

And I hear the Savior say
"Thy strength indeed is small
Child of weakness watch and pray
Find in Me thine all in all"

--

'Cause Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow
(It's washed away)
(All my sin and all my shame)

--

Lord now indeed I find
Thy pow'r and Thine alone
Can change the leper's spots
And melt the heart of stone

--

'Cause Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow
(It's washed away)
(All my sin and all my shame)

--

And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete
Jesus died my soul to save
My lips shall still repeat

--

Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow (3x)

--

Oh praise the One Who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead

Jesus

What The Lord Has Done In Me
--

Let the weak say, "I am strong."
Let the poor say, "I am rich."
Let the blind say, "I can see;
It's what the Lord has done in me."

Hosanna, hosanna to the Lamb that was slain.
Hosanna, hosanna, Jesus died and rose again.

--

In-to the river I will wade.
There my sins are washed a-way.
From the heavens mercy streams
Of the Savior's love for me.

Hosanna, hosanna to the Lamb that was slain.
Hosanna, hosanna, Jesus died and rose again.

--

I will rise from waters deep
Into the saving arms of God.
I will sing salvation songs;
Jesus Christ has set me free.

Hosanna, hosanna to the Lamb that was slain.
Hosanna, hosanna, Jesus died and rose again.

--

Let the weak say, "I am strong."
Let the poor say, "I am rich."
Let the blind say, "I can see;
It's what the Lord has done in me."

Hosanna, hosanna to the Lamb that was slain.
Hosanna, hosanna, Jesus died and rose again.

House Of God Forever 
--

God is my Shepherd
I won't be wanting,
I won't be wanting
He makes me rest
In fields of green by quiet streams

--

Even though I walk
Through the valley of death and dying
I will not fear
For You are with me,
You're always with me

--

Your Shepherd's staff comforts me
You are my feast in the presence of enemies
Surely goodness will follow me, follow me
In the House of God, forever

--

The Love of Christ is Rich and Free
--

The love of Christ is rich and free
Fixed on His own eternally
Nor earth, nor hell, can it remove
Long as He lives, His own He’ll love

--

His loving heart engaged to be 
Their everlasting Surety
’Twas love that took their cause in hand
And love maintains it to the end 

--

Love cannot from its post withdraw
Nor death, nor hell, nor sin, nor law
Can turn the Surety’s heart away 
He’ll love His own to endless day

--

Love has redeemed His sheep with blood
And love will bring them safe to God
Love calls them all from death to life
And love will finish all their strife

--

He loves through every changing scene
Nor aught from Him can Zion wean 
Not all the wanderings of her heart 
Can make His love for her depart

--

Love cannot from its post withdraw
Nor death, nor hell, nor sin, nor law 
Can turn the Surety’s heart away
He’ll love His own to endless day

--

At death, beyond the grave, He’ll love
In endless bliss, His own shall prove 
The blazing glory of that love 
Which never could from them remove

How Great is Our God
--

The splendor of a King
clothed in Majesty
Let all the earth rejoice
All the earth rejoice

--

He wraps Himself in light
and darkness tries to hide
And trembles at His voice
Trembles at His voice

--

How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, all will see
How great, how great is our God

--

Age to age He stands
and time is in His hands
Beginning and the end
Beginning and the end

--

The Godhead, three in one
Father, Spirit, Son
The Lion and the Lamb
The Lion and the Lamb

--

How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, all will see
How great, how great is our God

--

Name above all names
Worthy of all Praise
My heart will sing
How great is our God
(2x)

How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, all will see
How great, how great is our God
