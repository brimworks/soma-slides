O For a Thousand Tongues
--

O, for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer praise
The glories of my God and King
The triumphs of His grace

--

My gracious Master and my God
Assist me to proclaim
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honors of Thy name

--

Jesus! The name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease,
Tis music in the sinner ears,
Tis life and health and peace.

--

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

--

He breaks the power of cancelled sin
He sets the prisoners free
His blood can make the foulest clean
His blood availed for me

--

Here Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb,
Your loosened tongues employ;
Ye blind, behold your Savior come;
And leap, ye lame, for joy.

--

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

--

Glory to God and praise and love
Be ever, ever given
By saints below and saints above
The church in earth and Heaven

--

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

In Christ Alone
--

In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm

--

What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
My Comforter, my All in All
Here in the love of Christ I stand

--

In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save

--

Till on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

--

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again

--

And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

--

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny

--

No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand

Victory in Jesus
--

I heard an old, old story,
How a savior came from glory
How He gave his life on Calvary
To save a wretch like me
I heard about His groaning,
His precious blood’s atoning
Then I repented of my sins
And won the victory

--

Oh victory in Jesus, my Savior forever
He sought me and bought me
With his redeeming blood
He loved me ere I knew him
And all my love is due him
He plunged me to victory
Beneath the cleansing flood

--

I heard about his healing,
Of His cleansing power revealing
How He made the lame to walk again
And caused the blind to see
And then I cried dear Jesus,
Come and heal my broken Spirit
And some how Jesus came
And bought to me the victory

--

Oh victory in Jesus, my Savior forever
He sought me and bought me
With his redeeming blood
He loved me ere I knew him
And all my love is due him
He plunged me to victory
Beneath the cleansing flood

--

I heard about a mansion
He has built for me in Glory
And I heard about the streets
Of Gold beyond the crystal sea
About the angels singing
And the old redemption story
And some sweet day I’ll sing up there
The song of victory

--

Oh victory in Jesus, my Savior forever
He sought me and bought me
With his redeeming blood
He loved me ere I knew him
And all my love is due him
He plunged me to victory
Beneath the cleansing flood
