Rock of Ages
--

Rock of Ages, cleft for me
Let me hide myself in Thee
Let the water and the blood
From Thy wounded side which flowed
Be of sin the double cure
Save from wrath and make me pure

--

Not the labor of my hands
Can fulfill the law's demands
Could my zeal no languor know
Could my tears forever flow
All for sin could not atone
Thou must save and Thou alone

--

Nothing in my hand I bring
Simply to the cross I cling
Naked, come to Thee for dress
Helpless, look to Thee for grace
Vile, I to the fountain fly
Wash me, Savior, or I die

--

While I draw this fleeting breath
When my eyelids close in death
When I rise to worlds unknown
See Thee on Thy judgement throne
Rock of Ages, cleft for me
Let me hide myself in Thee

--
O For a Thousand Tongues
--

O, for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer praise
The glories of my God and King
The triumphs of His grace

--

My gracious Master and my God
Assist me to proclaim
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honors of Thy name

--

Jesus! The name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease,
Tis music in the sinner ears,
Tis life and health and peace.

--

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

--

He breaks the power of cancelled sin
He sets the prisoners free
His blood can make the foulest clean
His blood availed for me

--

Here Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb,
Your loosened tongues employ;
Ye blind, behold your Savior come;
And leap, ye lame, for joy.

--

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

--

Glory to God and praise and love
Be ever, ever given
By saints below and saints above
The church in earth and Heaven

--

Praise the name of Jesus!
Praise the name of Jesus!

Sermon
--

--
How Deep the Father's Love for Us
--

How deep the Father's love for us
How vast beyond all measure
That He would give His only Son
To make a wretch His treasure

--

How great the pain of searing loss
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the chosen One
Bring many sons to glory

--

Behold the Man upon a cross
My guilt upon His shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers 

--

It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished

--

I will not boast in anything
No gifts, no powers, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection

--

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom

--
How Great is Our God
--

The splendor of a King
clothed in Majesty
Let all the earth rejoice
All the earth rejoice

--

He wraps Himself in light
and darkness tries to hide
And trembles at His voice
Trembles at His voice

--

How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, all will see
How great, how great is our God

--

Age to age He stands
and time is in His hands
Beginning and the end
Beginning and the end

--

The Godhead, three in one
Father, Spirit, Son
The Lion and the Lamb
The Lion and the Lamb

--

How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, all will see
How great, how great is our God

--

Name above all names
Worthy of all Praise
My heart will sing
How great is our God
(2x)

--

How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, all will see
How great, how great is our God

--
Nothing but the Blood
--

What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow.
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

For my pardon, this I see,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
For my cleansing this my plea,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow.
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

Nothing can for sin atone,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
Naught of good that I have done,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow.
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

This is all my hope and peace.
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
This is all my righteousness.
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow.
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

--
There is a Fountain
--

There is a fountain filled with blood
drawn from Emmanuel's veins
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains

--

The dying thief rejoiced to see
that fountain in his day;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away

--

Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
shall never lose its power
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved, to sin no more
Be saved, to sin no more
Be saved, to sin no more
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved, to sin no more

--

E'er since, by faith, I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die
And shall be till I die
And shall be till I die
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die

--

When this poor lisping, stammering
tongue lies silent in the grave.
Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I'll sing Thy power to save
I'll sing Thy power to save
I'll sing Thy power to save
Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I'll sing Thy power to save
